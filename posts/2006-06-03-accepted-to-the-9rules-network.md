title: Accepted to the 9rules network
---

I just wanted to drop a note to everyone that [I got accepted](http://9rules.com/blog/2006/06/round-4-list/) to the [9rules network](http://9rules.com). 9rules is a network for all kinds of quality content and you just need to have a quick look at the members to see that they attract the right people. It will be very interesting to see what this leads to!

In other news my site was mentioned in the swedish magazine "Mobil" that covers everything about mobile phones (no article available online). They had an article about how to make a website for your phone and ended with a list links. In that list was my [beginners guide](/css/beginners-guide-to-css-and-standards/) and the rest rest of the page was a gigantic screenshoot of my frontpage. Fun! :)

Traffic is also increasing again after people jumped on the "Knowledge levels of [Add your thing here]". Roger has a [post about some levels of articles](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200606/web_knowledge_levels/)

Can you tell I'm happy? I AM! :)

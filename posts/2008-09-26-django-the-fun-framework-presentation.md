Yesterday I attended the excellent [Geek Meet](http://robertnyman.com/geekmeet/) hosted by Robert Nyman at the Creuna office. I held a presentation about the Django web framework, and took some time today to add some comments in english and make a PDF-file of the presentation. Would you like to know why Django is more fun than what you're using right now?

So go ahead and have a look at the presentation: **[Django - the fun framework](/files/Django%20-%20the%20fun%20framework.pdf)** (11 Mb, PDF with english comments)

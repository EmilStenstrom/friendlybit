Hi! If you&#8217;re reading this blog through your feed reader, today is a good day to break out of it and have a look at the site. There&#8217;s been several little changes throughout, and I invite you to click around and explore things. **Let me know if you find anything broken**!

  1. Comments have moved up to the top and gotten more space. That includes the comment form which have been an insult to people wanting to comment. I&#8217;m hoping you reward me by correcting me even more often.
  2. I&#8217;m using Google for my searches. Instead of trying to patch the builtin wordpress search I&#8217;m just linking to google from the header. It gives both faster and better results.
  3. Design-wise it&#8217;s much &#8220;lighter&#8221; than before. The old one felt hard and heavy, and didn&#8217;t look to be as open as it in fact is.
  4. Widgetized. I&#8217;m using wordpress widgets all over the place, which makes the administration of things like the &#8220;recent comments&#8221; easier. I just log in and change a number from the admin interface.
  5. Fluid width (between 1000 and 1250 pixels).
  6. Much nicer CSS, with a structure that you can actually follow.
  7. I&#8217;ve [promised](/other/new-design-for-friendlybit/) you the number of feed readers clearly visible, and I&#8217;m still going to get it done. But I&#8217;m not done yet.

No matter what I will keep what I&#8217;ve always done with comments: I will read each and every comment you post, and I won&#8217;t close articles for comments even though they are a year old. I will keep replying to (almost) all posts within a couple of days. I won&#8217;t delete your comment just because I disagree with what you&#8217;re saying, and I will go back and correct the original article with any errors you find.

**You** are what makes this blog what it is. I could have written all my texts in word instead (and some of you probably wish I did sometimes), but that would have been totally meaningless. Feedback is what makes this blog go around.

**Thanks!**

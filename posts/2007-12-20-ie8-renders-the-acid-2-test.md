title: IE8 renders the acid 2 test
---

I'm not sure why I don't see that many people talking about the fact that [IE8 renders the acid 2 test perfectly](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/19/internet-explorer-8-and-acid2-a-milestone.aspx) now. It really seems Microsoft is starting to move forward again, after starting to feel some pressure from the open source world. Will they be able to pick up the speed needed to get 96% marketshare again? Time will tell.

> **Update**: Good [interview about IE8](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=367207) on channel9.

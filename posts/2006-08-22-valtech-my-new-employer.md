Just wanted to let you know that I have accepted a job at [Valtech](http://www.valtech.com). My title will be "technical consultant" (which could mean anything, I know :), and you have probably already guessed that I will be focusing on HTML and CSS; interface design in different forms. I started working last Thursday so today was my fourth day and I must say that I really like it there. A friendly atmosphere amongst (very) skilled developers is what I've seen so far, and I know how much that counts when it comes great results.

Anyway. I'm sure you'll just think I'm practicing my sales speak so I'll stop there :) (I’m not damnit!). As I said I'll be working as a consultant, which means I'm dependent on customers wanting interfaces made. So feel free to [contact me](/contact/) or [my employer](http://www.valtech.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=2057) (Swedish link) if you have an interesting project you need help with.

(Don't worry, I won't stop posting here, I have a big post about my first project coming up)

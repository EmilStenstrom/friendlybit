Everyone [except Microsoft themselves](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer-6-Support-Continues-Despite-Calls-for-PhaseOut-307122/) are talking about the death of IE6. I&#8217;ve tried [motivating people to drop support](/browsers/motivation-for-building-for-ie6/), arguing that you at least can show IE6 users a message. Many have replied with &#8220;but our IT department doesn&#8217;t let us&#8230;&#8221;, and I can say nothing more than that the IT department is filled with humans. Which means they are lazy, and upgrade when people whine enough about it. It&#8217;s a shame it has to be that way, that we have to [punish people for their IT departments](http://www.ie6nomore.com/corporate-users.html), but that&#8217;s how it has to be.

As **web developers**, we should be the ones complaining the loudest. We have so much to win on IE6:s death it&#8217;s silly. Just look at the below list of things IE6 can&#8217;t do, but IE7 can (the next worst browser):

  * Native PNG alpha transparency without silly hacks.
  * Several selectors: Child selector (&#8220;&gt;&#8221;), Adjacent sibling selector (&#8220;+&#8221;), Attribute selectors ([attr=value]), and [General sibling selector](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#general-sibling-combinators) (&#8220;~&#8221;, CSS3)
  * Min-height, Max-height, Min-width, Max-width
  * Multiple class/id selectors in the same ruleset (ie. .class1.class2 { &#8230; })
  * :hover on all elements, not just links
  * position: fixed
  * Native XMLHTTP (Without ActiveX)
  * International Domain Names (IDN), the ability to use UTF-8 chars in domains
  * Page zoom that zooms the whole page (don&#8217;t worry about zoom)

This is a huge step forward for us web developers. Huge! Bigger then when CSS3 comes out, because we won&#8217;t be able to use that one for years. Someone is pushing the front of what&#8217;s possible, I&#8217;m pushing for the front of what&#8217;s **usable**.

What can you do to help me get everything in the above list? And, did I forget something?

I&#8217;d never this that this day would come, but it actually seems that **Google** has decided to block all sites in their index. Try searching anything, it will be marked as spam. I see the same results in the swedish and english version, in Firefox and in Internet Explorer. &#8220;This site may harm your computer&#8221;, clicking that link does not seem to be possible, and I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s because it gets millions of hits right now.

**Gmail** is also marking emails as spam, they are probably using the same system as Google search. The warning message is: This message may not be from whom it claims to be.

  * [**Techcrunch** found out](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/31/google-flags-whole-internet-as-malware/) just a couple of minutes after this post.
  * **Twitter** is buzzing with people trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on.

**~40 minutes later**: Google is working just fine again, no need for panic. They have even written a [blog post on the issue](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-your-computer-on.html), explaining what happened. Seems the URL &#8220;/&#8221; was mistakenly added as a &#8220;bad URL&#8221; in the spam filters. Human error obviously.

Heads will be rolling at the Google HQ (or at least someone just got a new nickname).

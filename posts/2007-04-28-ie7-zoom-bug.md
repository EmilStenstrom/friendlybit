IE7 shipped with a new and improved Page Zoom feature that lets you zoom more than just the text of the page. While I think I like it (there's many saying it will make developers lives easier), it has its bugs.

The most recent one I've seen is its failure to [correctly calculate text width](/files/ie7_zoom_bug/). I've found no fix for this, except adding a right-margin, something that renders the box too wide instead of too narrow. The calculation seems to a little bit better with `font-style: italic;`, but it's still incorrect.

It you have a fix, let me know in the [comments](#comments) (the usual stuff does not seem to work).

I guess the Page Zoom is hard to implement, since basic things like that breaks. At the other hand, Opera has had it for years, and Firefox will in version 3. I really look forward to explaining this to customers :)

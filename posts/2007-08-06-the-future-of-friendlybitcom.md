It&#8217;s vacation time and you&#8217;re allowed to lean back and just relax. A blog it&#8217;s always there though, you post to it on your spare time, and as soon as you have some a little glitch in your schedule you need to consider blogging. It&#8217;s a full time job.

## Current situation

I use Friendly Bit as a way to express **my thoughts and ideas** about web development. Why? Partly because I&#8217;m passionate about the web, passionate to make it a better place. I want people to see the possibilities it holds, and make use of it in the best way possible. I want people to see the web from different angles, sometimes from an accessibility standpoint and sometimes from the eyes of a designer. I want people to think about what they are doing, every line of code they are putting down, instead of typing with auto-pilot turned on.

That&#8217;s me, trying to get my point out to you. What&#8217;s equally important is **your feedback**. If I make a mistake, I instantly get it pointed out by people like you, that know what they are doing. If I write something outstanding I get told that aswell, but not by simple &#8220;well done&#8221; one-liners, but by thought-out reflections, again, by people like you.

## The future

Since it&#8217;s vacation, I get the time to sit down and think about how I want things to develop here. And what I&#8217;ve come to realize is that I&#8217;ve underestimated the value of you and your feedback. What do I mean by that? Well, every damn comment (not spam, mind you), gives something back to me, something that I can use to write an even better article next time. I have not acknowledged that enough, that every comment is valuable to me.

Where Joel on Software thinks [comments infringe his freedom of expression](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html), I of course disagree. I find it utterly silly that they would.

Anyway. What it all boils down to, is that I need to make this site mirror my feelings about my readers&#8230; I&#8217;d like to move from a blog where I talk and you listen, to a platform where **we** talk. Of course that isn&#8217;t an easy task. I can&#8217;t force you to just &#8220;be more active&#8221;. I can&#8217;t force you to help each other and post your &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; here. That&#8217;s not how a community works, and it shouldn&#8217;t be.

## Moving to a community

What I want to do is make it easy and convenient to interact with the site. To lift everything you do and write and show it to everyone. I know there&#8217;s about 1000 people subscribing to my feed (about 300 daily visitors). Let&#8217;s say one tenth of those, 100 loyal subscribers, are people really read what is posted and are willing to give feedback on some of it. Wouldn&#8217;t that be a good crowd to show **your** ideas to?

I&#8217;m not saying I would post less, and expect you to fill the blanks. No, I would still post as much as I do right now, one article every other week. I would still read every comment. But I think there should be a way for you to start topics/articles and ask questions. And not only talk to boring me, to the other loyal 100.

The important question here is: **Is this something you want?** Would Friendly Bit still be as exciting if it was a community instead of a blog? Would you stay?

Mind you, I will read every single reply to this post carefully, and decide where to go from here. Thanks!

Have you even tried clicking an &#8220;Add to cart&#8221;-button and not understood what happened? I have. An although I understand the idea of adding a product to the cart, and then letting the user continue browsing from where he is, I still get stumped when &#8220;nothing happens&#8221; when I click the button. So what to do?

Simple: Add a **animation from the add button to the cart**. That way you communicate what just happened. &#8220;The product moved in there, and by clicking the cart you&#8217;ll find it again. Now continue buying stuff!&#8221;.

Somebody must have done this before, so I started looking for a <a class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" rel="homepage" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin to do this (jQuery was already on the page, so why not?). I found add2cart &#8211; A plugin that looks good, but that misses a few features I wanted:

  * The **animation duration** is set in seconds, meaning products further down the page will move faster than those further up. I wanted constant speed.
  * It didn&#8217;t allow me to **customize the look** of the animated element.
  * The code rely on concatenating strings of CSS and generally could use **lots of improvement**.

So I did what anyone would do: rewrote the code from scratch, and posted it on GitHub.

**Get the code: [Animate From To 1.0](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/jQuery-animate_from_to)**

It&#8217;s my first jQuery plugin ever, and my first public GitHub project, so let me know if I&#8217;ve done something wrong. Is this something that could be useful in one of your projects?

Hi. Today I want to tell you about a music player called [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/), that I like. What does that have to do with web development? Nothing, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s in the &#8220;other&#8221; category :)

Anyway. Spotify is a lot like **Pandora**, you know that music player that runs as a flash applet and suggests music based on your votes. Except Spotify comes as a standalone application, and doesn&#8217;t suggest music. And it works outside of the US. Oh, wait, it&#8217;s not at all like Pandora.

Instead, it&#8217;s very similar to **Last.fm**, that massive music site that plays songs based on your tags, and suggests music if you pay for it. Well, except Spotify does not have tags, and it&#8217;s free. Bah, it&#8217;s not at all like Last.fm.

Oh, now I know, it&#8217;s like having downloaded **thousands of MP3s** from some P2P network. MP3s you worked damn hard to find. But then again, music on Spotify is legal, and there&#8217;s a lots more music there than what you will ever have on your hard drive. Damn it, it&#8217;s not like downloaded music&#8230;

Aha! Now I know. It&#8217;s like **Winamp**, but with a huge library of music, that you store on a remote server instead of on your own hard drive. A Winamp that can play and combine radio stations based on genres, filter out music from a certain century, and play full albums if you want to. A Winamp that&#8217;s fully searchable on both artist, song title, and album, that displays CD covers, biographies and suggests similar artists. You guessed it right, it&#8217;s not at all like Winamp.

Stay on the lookout for Spotify, soon released on an interweb near you.

title: Google statistics over HTML usage
---

Google Code has done extensive research over the use of HTML today. Since this is Google doing the job they had access to an enormous amount of data, over a billion documents where analysed. What does the report conclude? Pretty much what we already know: people don't use HTML for structure like its intended.

Here are some examples of strange usage in the report:

  * `<head>` is used more often than `<html>`. No comment.
  * `<table>` is the ninth most used element. I have serious doubts that this is due to the amount of tabular data on the web.
  * The third most used classname is "title" and the fourth "small". The first could probably be replaced by a header tag, the other one should certainly be set by CSS since it's style.
  * Half of all `<body>` elements contains the "bgcolor" attribute. If this isn't style, what is?

The report tells a lot about the shape of the web. If I only could get more people to read my [beginners guide](/css/beginners-guide-to-css-and-standards/)…

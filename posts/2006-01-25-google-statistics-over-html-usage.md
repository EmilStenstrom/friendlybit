Google Code has done extensive research over the use of HTML today. Since this is Google doing the job they had access to an enormous amount of data, over a billion documents where analysed. What does the report conclude? Pretty much what we already know: people don&#8217;t use HTML for structure like its intended.

Here are some examples of strange usage in the report:

  * `<head>` is used more often than `<html>`. No comment.
  * `<table>` is the ninth most used element. I have serious doubts that this is due to the amount of tabular data on the web.
  * The third most used classname is &#8220;title&#8221; and the fourth &#8220;small&#8221;. The first could probably be replaced by a header tag, the other one should certainly be set by CSS since it&#8217;s style.
  * Half of all `<body>` elements contains the &#8220;bgcolor&#8221; attribute. If this isn&#8217;t style, what is?

The report tells a lot about the shape of the web. If I only could get more people to read my [beginners guide](/css/beginners-guide-to-css-and-standards/)&#8230;

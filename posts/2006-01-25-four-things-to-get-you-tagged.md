There&#8217;s a few questions circling the blogsphere. I better pass them on just to avoid the angry CSS gods.

## Four jobs I&#8217;ve had in my life

  * Folder of mighty envelopes
  * Cutter of complex vegetables
  * Administrator of Nokia Online
  * Web developer for my own company

## Four movies I can watch over and over

  * Magnolia
  * Matrix
  * Memento
  * Mind the Gap

Oh, that&#8217;s only the ones on M&#8230; :)

## Four places I have lived

Four places? Let&#8217;s make all four of them Stockholm, Sweden.

## Four TV shows I love to watch

No, no, NO! I can smile and nod when people talk about Desperate Housewives or Lost, but truth is I don&#8217;t have a clue. I&#8217;d rather read some feed than look at non-interactive TV ;)

## Four places I have been on vacation

  * Kobenhavn, Denmark
  * Amsterdam, Netherlands
  * Paris, France
  * Marseille, France (all four on the same trip)

## Four of my favourite dishes

  * Pancakes!
    I can&#8217;t really think of four dishes that I like particularly much. I&#8217;m a student so noodles and spaghetti are the frequent ones.

## Four websites I visit daily

  * Stylegala &#8211; Webdev community
  * [Dooce](http://www.dooce.com) &#8211; Great humourus writer (about life)
  * [Waiterrant](http://www.waiterrant.net) &#8211; Also a great writer (about being a waiter)
  * <a href="http://www.d.kth.se" lang="sv">Datasektionen</a> &#8211; The program on the university where I study

## Four places I would rather be right now

  * Out travelling with someone I like
  * Ireland &#8211; Seeing if the Pubs are as nice as they say
  * Iceland &#8211; Trekking, climbing, all kinds of adventure sports
  * Prague &#8211; Dancing in one of the great techno clubs I&#8217;ve heard of

## Four bloggers I am tagging (all from the #CSS help channel)

  * G1nx
  * [trevor](http://personaldevelopment.ca/)
  * [csarven](http://www.csarven.ca)
  * taare

Yesterday the Internet Explorer Team showed a big change in attitude. Listening to [developer feedback about IE8](/css/ie8-and-doctype-switching/), they [changed their mind](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx), and now IE8 will render standards mode pages using the latest and greatest it can offer.

This is not only a sane way to approach standards, but it&#8217;s also a way to say &#8220;We&#8217;re listening and are open to change based on your feedback&#8221; (Although saying the reason is the new Interoperability standards and not user feedback is rather weak).

This move is great for both for the web in general and for the Internet Explorer Team. Let there be celebration!

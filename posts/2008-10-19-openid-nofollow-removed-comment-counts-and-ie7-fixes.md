I&#8217;m added a few features to the site:

**OpenID support**: Instead of typing your name and e-mail you could instead sign in with an OpenID-enabled URL. Or you could completely ignore it, and go on as usual.

**Nofollow restriction removed**: WordPress by default adds rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; to all links that people write in comments. It&#8217;s a good way to decrease the impact of spam. Thing is, I strictly moderate comments, and have three plugins that prevent spam (Akismet, Spam Karma 2, and Bad Behavior). Since spam really isn&#8217;t a problem, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the nofollow from your links, if you&#8217;ve posted more than three comments.

**Comment counts**: To make it easier to see who you can trust and not in the comments I&#8217;ve added a comment count next to the name. Damn, I&#8217;ve commented a lot :)

**IE7 fixes**: There were script errors in IE7 since I&#8217;m trying to do funky stuff with opacity on the search field. I&#8217;ve fixed that. Also, the number of subscribers wasn&#8217;t visible in IE7. They are now.

Over and out.

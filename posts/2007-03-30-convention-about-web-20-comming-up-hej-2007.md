_For all the Swedish readers here:_

The 21:th of April there's a big convention coming up that I hope you don't miss. **hej! 2007** takes on the wide and fuzzy topic of Web 2.0 and presents speakers from a wide array of Swedish companies. I'll certainly be there and I hope you will too. Have a look at:

See you there! (and let me know in the comments if you will attend)

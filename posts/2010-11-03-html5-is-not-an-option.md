HTML5 is HOT! Developers all over the world are adapting their sites, browsers are catching up, and new fallback solutions are released every day. But many developers misunderstand one thing:

> **You can't choose to use HTML5 or not, your site will be parsed as HTML5 no matter what.**

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-656" style="max-width: 100%;" title="no-choice" src="/files/post-media/no-choice-e1288811809935.jpg" alt="Voting is pointless. I am your leader now. It is useless to resist me." />

The reason is simple, HTML5 is made to be backwards compatible with the current web, so browsers don't need to keep their current parsers. All of them have soon switched to HTML5 parsers. You want to continue using HTML4? Not possible.

Now. You **can** choose whether you want to use the new features or not: New semantic tags, Microdata attributes, new form field types, accessibility features, 10-15 new JavaScript API:s (depending on how you count). Lots of new interesting stuff to learn.

So, go read up on HTML5 if you haven't already, but don't think you can keep using HTML4. Your site is being switched over as we speak.

I&#8217;ve seen them so many times: pages where the HTML is mighty fine (!) but the CSS looks like it&#8217;s taken straight from Dreamweaver. While I hate having to deal with those kinds of designs there is something good about them. They prove the point that HTML and CSS are two separate units, and that it&#8217;s possible to mess up one of them and do fine on the other. That&#8217;s after all the point of CSS&#8230;

Now. A much more unusual combination is good CSS together with bad HTML. So I put together a little example for you. [Separation illustrated](/files/separation_illustrated/) (only works in Firefox, I&#8217;m lazy). I&#8217;ve made all lines about 80 characters long and removed all other whitespace. Enjoy!

How&#8217;s that for a company website?

Hi, this is just a short post to let you know that [Safari is now available on windows](http://www.apple.com/safari/). It&#8217;s was unveiled at the [World Wide Developer Conference 2007](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) by Steve jobs himself.

I can&#8217;t stress enough how important this is for all Safari users. Most developers still use Windows when developing web sites (it&#8217;s changing, but don&#8217;t try to fool me, we&#8217;re not there yet). Will all these developers test in Safari? Hell no, even though there&#8217;s probably some hacky way to get Safari running, but I doubt many will go through the hassle of doing it. I know I don&#8217;t. I also know that I now will test in Safari. For starters, this site is broken, need to fix.

**Congratulations all users of Safari**, you have a bright future ahead of you. Also congratulations to Apple, for [playing their cards exactly right](http://www.macrumorslive.com/) (first Intel Macs, now this).

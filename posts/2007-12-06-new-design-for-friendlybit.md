Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I&#8217;m now working on the new friendlybit. I&#8217;ve listened to your [previous comments](/other/the-future-of-friendlybitcom/), and these are the changes I&#8217;m going to make/not make:

  * **Blog format stays**, no community. You&#8217;re damn conservative (something like 95% percent said to keep it a blog).
  * **More compact writing**. I&#8217;ll skip more of the fluffy wording, and concentrate on what I want said. That means shorter posts.
  * **WYSIWYG-editor** inside WordPress (my blogging tool) gets turned on. This might make the HTML somewhat worse, but It makes my job easier, so I&#8217;ll try anyways.
  * **Paid links gets removed**. I previously sold links on the frontpage and got like $200 a month from them. I&#8217;ve now removed them, since:
      1. It seems to be hip inside the Googleplex to kick on people making money from other things than AdSense.
      2. I have no idea if the PageRank drop from PR6 to PR4 is caused by them, but I&#8217;m still going to hope that was the case. We&#8217;ll see.
      3. To show to myself that blogging isn&#8217;t about money. Now I most definitely don&#8217;t blog for the money.
  * **Number of feed readers** will be used as a way of seeing if I do my job or not. This will also be shown at the top of all pages, so you will be able to follow them too.
  * **Comments will be central**, as [Jesse Skinner suggested](/other/the-future-of-friendlybitcom/#comment-26790). For now, I&#8217;m just moving them up, above the fold, but we&#8217;ll see where we end up.
  * **New design** underway. As a token of me caring for you (and me wanting to steal your skills), I thought I&#8217;d post a screenshoot of it here:

But. This damn layout is to narrow, so I&#8217;ll just paste a link instead: [New friendlybit design](http://friendlybit.com/files/friendlybit_single_export.png). Some ideas (all changable if you give me good reasons):[

](http://friendlybit.com/files/friendlybit_single_export.png)

  * It will be flexible width, between 800 and 1024 pixels.
  * Content and comments will each take up approx 50% of the page width, so you&#8217;ll get plenty of eyeballs on your comments.
  * I don&#8217;t know the height of the columns, so I&#8217;ll just let them expand downwards as long as they need to be.
  * I won&#8217;t make it work in IE6 (on purpose). This is for my own satisfaction, and seriously, any decent web developer should already have something better. Stats say 60% Firefox, 16% IE7, and 14% IE6. Please upgrade people. I will test it in the latest version of Opera (4.2%) and Safari (4.5%). Why? Because I want more users with good browsers, and fewer with bad. And since this is a personal blog, I can choose. Yay!

Now. Do I have to tell you I want your feedback on that?

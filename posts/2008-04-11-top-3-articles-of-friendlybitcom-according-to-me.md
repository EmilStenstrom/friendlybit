[Robert](http://www.robertnyman.com/) taunted me cause my blog was to inactive, so I thought I'd write something. As you might imagine, pushing me terribly to be creative like that isn't a good way to get good posts up, so I thought I'd just point to some existing articles instead. The selection is not based on popularity, ratings, number of visitors, comments, or anything like that. It's based on me. :)

Now. First up is **my post on [Justin Timberlake](/css/dear-justin-timberlake/)**. Surprised? There's lots of good things to say about that one. It was very fun to write, I love writing letters to totally unlikely people, and that was what I did. Secondly, there's a couple of great comments on that post from people that seriously thought there was a chance that Justin would read it. Isn't that like, desperate? Damn right it is. Thirdly, a couple of weeks after that post [Robert](http://www.robertnyman.com/) pulled me aside for a chat: "Don't get upset by this, cause I just want to ask something". "Yes?", I replied, seeing he was somewhat uncomfortable. "Well… Are you gay? I mean that post about Justin some time ago…". What?! Can't you declare your love to a man nowadays without being called gay?! My god! :) (Update: Girlfriend is telling me to point people to the disclaimer below that post. Yeye.)

Number two of my favorite posts is **my little [webstandards hero](/html/web-standards-hero-episode-1/) thingie**. I just got bored of the regular blog format and decided I should try something else. A comic book sounded like a good plan and I just started writing, making up little twists along the way. I like the end result, but I didn't get that many readers (according to stats). Perhaps the webdev world wasn't ready for plastic figures yet. Sad…

Third, and last, on this toplist is **of course [Real hackers don't use CSS](/css/real-hackers-dont-use-css/)**. Again, I'm experimenting with style, and that one actually worked :) It still gets lots of visitors, and hopefully some nice laughs from people. My faviourite response was people from reddit, that were **really** upset that I used the term hackers like I did. How could I abuse it like that? How could I smear the fine shimmer of gold that emits from someone that can write Perl really well? Because I'm a mean evil person. Of course.

What can I learn from my own favorite posts? That I should experiment with style more. You'll see more of that, I can assure you!

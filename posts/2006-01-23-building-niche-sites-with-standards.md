I'm starting a new series of articles here at Friendly Bit. Through the use of web standards I will build a couple of niched sites and walk you through every step of the process. My hope is that this will make it easier for at least a few of you out there to understand what this web standards fuzz is all about. The use of web standards together with your creativity will make building websites fun again.

The first niche examined is _online poker_. The examination ended in a tutorial on [how to build a poker site](/css/semantic-poker-template/). What are you waiting for? Go read it!

My hope is that the templates will spread all the way to the niche markets they are made for. I appreciate any help with that. No matter what, I hope they will be great articles to learn from. Do you have anything to add? Use the comments.

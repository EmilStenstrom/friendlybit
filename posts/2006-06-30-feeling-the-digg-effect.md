Hi people! I just wanted to say I&#8217;m sorry for the downtime/slowness recently. My post Real hackers don&#8217;t use CSS got digged which meant I got LOTS of traffic. Fortunately I got some help first .htaccess redirecting digg traffic to duggmirror (they save digged posts automatically). That took the pressure down enough so I could install WP-Cache and get it configured. Now the site is back up again and is probably also faster for all of you.

Thanks for sticking to this site, I love you all! (lot&#8217;s of good articles on the way, stay tuned)

(A note: I use [stacken](http://www.stacken.kth.se/) as my host and it was not their fault the server got slow; wordpress just uses up too many mysql connections and a proper cache fixes that.)

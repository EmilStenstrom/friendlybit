W3C is producing lots and lots of good specifications and we seriously have their joined effort to thank for a lot of today&#8217;s web. But everything released by them isn&#8217;t all nice. I&#8217;ve digged deep into obscure search results to find, that&#8217;s right, the **silliest specifications ever**. \*Drumroll\*.

[HTML+TIME](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLplusTIME): Why not add timers to HTML? Didn&#8217;t you always want to only display that div only the first 4 seconds after load. Could this be combined with the blink tag somehow?

[Predefined icon entities](http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-wwwicn.html): No more images needed! Instead, let browsers implement whatever icons they want and just use them by typing &calculator;, &fax; or &www;. I love the example icon for &gopher;, is that an orc?

[CURIE Syntax](http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/): There are also huge specifications for nothing. What about a 2000+ word specifcation for the syntax: &#8220;charcters:characters&#8221;? This is what happens when you put too many &#8220;scientists&#8221; in one room.

[Micropayments in HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-Micropayment-Markup-19990825/): If you&#8217;re going to make micropayments on the web, first build your payment system, then add lots of attributes you don&#8217;t need. Then make sure you pick a short code for your payment system, and get that one in the spec. Ehmm. No.

[Selecting Payment Over HTTP](http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-jepi-uppflow-970106): If you are into paying, but don&#8217;t really like interfaces, this one is for you. You can&#8217;t pay through it though, just select how to pay. Makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it?

[CSS Marquee Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-css3-marquee-20080801/): Remember the `marquee` element? What if you could implement that on any element, using only CSS3? Isn&#8217;t marquee behavior? I guess not. &#8220;The deadline for comments is 1 September 2008&#8221;.

[Accessibility for old people](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/): Very strange. This isn&#8217;t a specification but a literature review. Could this be the first step for W3C to go into book recommendations? I love the chapter of how to define an old person.

That&#8217;s all I can find. Now I leave it open to you to fill in with the comments about how useful they could be, and how SOAP should be in the list. Over to you, dear audience.

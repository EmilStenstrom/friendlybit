  comment_content: Emil,\n\nThanks so much for providing such a friendly tutorial
    for those of us still learning CSS!\n\nI'm a technical writer by trade, and I
    really appreciate the tone and organization of your writing.  It's helped me to
    understand CSS a little better in the time I've taken to read it.

    the template page that you provided.\n\nI think a mention of www.csszengarden.com
    would be good too.

  comment_content: This is a great article for a beginner of HTML.If you could write
    more CSS properties and where can we find such a list of them then we can get
    a direction towards the next level in CSS designing.

    but put the code just after the body start to help the search engines get to it

  comment_content: Thanks,\nright help at the right time.\nI was on the verge of going
    back to tables frustrated with the explainations I found for CSS. \nThis tutorial
    saved my site from that.  I anticipate this summer being able to convert my site
    from badly coded tables to style separated from content pages.\nRJK

    CSS but can with tables... it works the otherway aroud to, some times the best
    way is to combine the two.

  comment_content: 'Nice writeup regarding CSS and HTML. I''m really glad to find
    that you''re using HTML 4.01 (Strict) instead of XHTML 1.0, and that''s good.\n\nActually
    I think a site is made up of 3 parts: content, presentation, and behavior. I could
    be wrong, just what I thought!\n\nJust curious, does all other browsers (except
    <abbr>MSIE</abbr>) have quirks mode rendering? (Besides the fact that they''re
    all great tag soup parsers.)\n\nAnd while I was scanning through, I was wondering
    why you suggested against the use of <code>b</code> and yet demonstrated the right
    usage of <code>em</code> instead. How about <code>strong</code>? With that we
    can really do away with <code>font-weight: bold;</code>! Well, at least to me
    it doesn''t matter if <code>strong</code> is a level more emphasis''d than <code>em</code>.
    Just some thoughts about this. I''m sure you have your reasons to do so. :)\n\nI''m
    not doubting you, and this is an article I''m sure alot newcomers can learn from.
    This comment is just me some 2 cents. Hope I''m not being too offensive.\n\nGood
    job.'

  comment_content: '@draco: A site is made up of as many parts as you want it to be,
    I could easiliy tell you 10 parts if you wanted. For this beginners guide 2 is
    enough.\n\nAll modern browsers have quirks mode/standards mode rendering, some
    even have a "almost standard" mode.\n\nI used em because that''s what I think
    most people mean when they use the b element. Strong is another level of emphasis,
    something that I don''t think makes it as good to start out with.\n\nThanks for
    you comments!  :)'

  comment_content: Hi!\nHow to position divs using CSS position:relative? When I try
    to position elements in this way it behaves like position:absolute.\nFor example:\n#something\n{\nposition:relative;\ntop:50px;\nleft:50px;\n}\nthis
    should position the element with id=something 50 pixels down and left from the
    previous element, yet in my case it behaves like absolute and places the element
    50px down and left from the starting coordinates of a document.  :(

  comment_content: Thank you, it has been many years since I have needed to use html.
    I want to build a professional looking site for a new venture I am undertaking.
    I downloaded a few templates that I thought would make this easier. Of course
    I had never used CSS, I fell flat on my face. This tut will help, has helped a
    lot. I will create a link to your site for sure, it is in direct interest to my
    targeted users.

  comment_content: Emil, nice work. Others have already commented on the usefulness,
    so I will simply add that you did a fantastic job of zeroing in on some very basic
    yet powerful concepts. You explained them very well, and your writing style is
    very pleasant. \n\nYour article is helpful, informative, direct, and a joy to
    read. I look forward to reading more of your work in the future!

  comment_content: Hello Emil,\nI've had a very little understanding to what CSS really
    is, even though I had a rough idea about what you can do with it. Then my Sister
    found a bunch of CSS sites while browsing and she shared the links with me. I
    clicked on yours first and I must say it is extremely helpful to my first attempts
    at getting a homepage based upon CSS done. Thanks a lot and keep up the good work!\nCheers,\nAndrea

  comment_content: I am finally finishing up my college education (started in the
    fall of '65) all online, and one of my courses this semester requires us to submit
    three papers on topics of our choice, within limits of the course, but they must
    be formatted with HTML, and the paper due next week must also use CSS and Meta
    tags.  My discovery of your article(s) couldn't have come at a better time.  And
    the info is simple enough that us older newbies can understand and use it.\n\nMany,
    many thanks.

  comment_content: The red stars on this form. I can see, whilst hovering over the
    asterix (star) that you have used the title attr. BUT those people WITHOUT browsers
    aware of title attr. AND users who MAY be color-blind do NOT know what red is
    or that the title attr. says 'Required'. It's just a small point, and I know it
    MAY seem nitpicking BUT one of the basic rules is do NOT use color alone to convey
    information, etc. Perhaps you could use the label or span attr. as well, and put
    in brackets next to the asterix (star) that the field is required.\n\nSorry if
    I came across as rude, wasn't meant to be.

    I''ve changed the word star to asterix to make the text a little clearer]'

  comment_content: Emil, I am impressed! To take something that is as "complicated"
    as CSS and put it across so well, is very well done. (I say complicated because
    some tutorials make you feel you should have a degree to work with css)Your level
    of communication is perfect for the level of reader you are dealing with. Thank
    you and keep up the good work and look forward to reading more. \nkind regards
    \nChris

  comment_content: What's your take on CSS Layer tags? I find them very easy to work
    with in the Dreavweaver environment, but I am getting W3C validator errors us
    the yin/yang. I have heard that there may be some  compatibily issues with different
    brousers, particularly Netscape. \nAnyway, thanx for the CSS tutorial. Now that
    I have read your four page tutorial, at least I have a basic understand how the
    CSS DIV tag works.

  comment_content: '@James Thomas: I must say I kinda dislike them. Dreamweaver is
    a good code editor but when it comes to "click and play" design it fails. Those
    layers you speak are not needed at all - CSS lets you position any element anywhere,
    just as if it was a div or anything else. Layers in Dreamweaver hides that and
    makes people think that layers are something special while they are just something
    the Dreamweaver folks made up. I would recommend coding by hand instead. Thanks
    for commenting!'

  comment_content: nice to see an up to date beginner's site. you could mention that
    page-authors are the least tolerant of befuddled beginner's questions. One thing
    about using css (I first used css for a project last year), is that I get ideas
    for how I'd like something to work, and have to try some dead-end and experiments
    before I get good results -  or before realize i <em>cannot</em> have the idea
    I'd conceived.

  comment_content: Well, OK.  I'm old (67) and have perhaps a different feeling about
    how to describe something.  It looks to me like CSS is an add-on to web formatting
    tools, something that enhances HTML.  CSS has a syntax, HTML has a syntax, and
    they're not the same syntax.  I have no problem with that (it makes sense that
    theyd be different), but what I'd like to see is at least a brief mention of itsyntax
    and syntax elements.  For instance, it's unclear to me which syntax elements of
    HTML  work within a .css file.  If I want to specify an image for the header in
    the CSS file is it exactly the same as the HTML syntax or is it different? \n\nI'm
    sure that, as I keep looking, I'll find the answer, but seeing   a statement about
    what HTML syntax is vlaid within a .css file and what is not would (I think) improve
    understanding.  This is only my second day of trying to learn CSS.\n\nThanks.

  comment_content: '@Brad: The syntax you use in the CSS file is completely different
    from HTML. In CSS you use: background: url(image.jpg); and in HTML you use &lt;img
    src="image.jpg">. CSS is a new language, specially made to work better for design.'

  comment_content: I'm in Brad's age-group so I relate!  First step for me was to
    change my thinking... think design of the website first, like you would design
    it on paper, this is the CSS  page (you can include all your notes in this style
    sheet, i.e. from building the skeleton, column layout, color &amp; size, to color,
    size &amp; style of fonts, alignment of Images &amp; Text).  Than I had to buy
    a book for reference, once you get it, than you really appreciate it (but I'm
    still learning)!

  comment_content: '[...] On the web the translation from static mockup to finished
    webpage is seldom so straightforward. Not only are a large number of design and
    layout issues not resolved until during the development process, there is a near
    certainty that the website will render slightly differently in each of the major
    web browsers. Quirks in the way different browsers interpret a website are something
    that web designers have learned to live with, especially with the advent of Cascading
    Style Sheets for controlling layout. We are happy to trade pixel perfection for
    semantic, accessible websites that are useable across a wide range of platforms,
    browsers and web enabled devices. [...]'

    if it is posible to use "a href" with target attribute inside a div in CSS to

    using "a href" with the target attribute in frames.\n\nSorry for the mistake,

  comment_content: People use CSS2 all the time, and they even already use parts of
    WHATWG HTML5 (like the CANVAS element, or contentEditable).\nI do not believe
    that the W3C HTML WG will complete recommendation status by 2008; and neither
    do I believe that that WG shall be disbanded late 2010.\nSpecification are usable
    before being finished but not before those parts are incorporated into User Agents,
    e.g., browsers. Safari, Mozilla and Opera (since they’re the copyright holders)
    may be the first to include HTML5 elements and attributes once they become stable,

  comment_content: The sites shown here are visually appealing. The use of css to
    handle the layout, graphics, backgrounds, links is very well handled. The only
    issue is the css over takes the message and clouds the content. Sometimes simplicity
    can speak volumes. Our initial designs for our firms site looked very similar
    to all the ones shown here. Is that a coincidence. I don’t think so. The web-designer
    was referencing these sites for layout ideas. I think that is common amongst many
    designers these days. There is so much out there that looks fantastic, that one
    feels the urge to do it themself. Most web 2.0 sites look the same. I think we
    can all agree on that.

  comment_content: Is there any way to download the complete beginner’s Guide to CSS
    in a pdf format? I tried to print it page by page but it seems to pprint 28 pages
    for each part (4 parts times 28!!!!). Clearly some of us are not interested to
    print comments of users.\n\nRegards,

  comment_content: I am finally finishing up my college education (started in the
    fall of ‘65) all online, and one of my courses this semester requires us to submit
    three papers on topics of our choice, within limits of the course, but they must
    be formatted with HTML, and the paper due next week must also use CSS and Meta
    tags. My discovery of your article(s) couldn’t have come at a better time. And
    the info is simple enough that us older newbies can understand and use it.

  comment_content: <i>I agree with Tobias as  he said :\n"But there are still things
    that you can’t do with CSS but can with tables…".\n</i>\n\nwell the best way is
    to combine the two types of html structures, but it is also a pity that IE and
    Firefox (most used) and other web browsers are not 100% compatible with CSS in
    meantime.\n\nI hope this will be fixed because it is always extra work to be done
    to re-write all the CSS for IE and firefox seperately. Though there are some "fix
    codes" in CSS it is still a problem to make a website view the same in all browsers.

  comment_content: 'Thanks for this. As an artist I find the amalgamation of coding
    and designing to be shit. I have been trying to design using tables since taking
    an interest in web design because I feel more at home with the visual interface,
    but it doesn''t work and it seems to offend people who consider themselves web
    designers (I see them more as web programmers). I am surprised that there isn''t
    a company or a group that has been established to support the development of tables
    as a visual layout device (has there?). I think it''s unbelievable that artists
    should be forced to learn programming in order to create and that the web ''design''
    community (that I''ve run into) are so full of indignation when I''ve suggested
    that the basic ''standards'' of creating in this medium are just wrong. I have
    a very clear idea of what it should look like: you open something with an interface
    like illustrator or photoshop, you create a page, you upload it to a server and
    it works - all of the programming is done for you behind the scenes, like driving
    a car - I don''t have to build the engine to drive it, right? Artists are becoming
    programmers and losing valuable time, inspiration and focus in the creative process,
    so is it any wonder that 99% of websites out there make you feel nothing at all?
    The internet, like life, should be full of strangeness, like a rich painting.
    But it gets older day by day.'

  comment_content: '@Bucko: Maybe that''s where we will land, time will tell. I''m
    not so sure though. To build a car, you need more than just the image of the car.
    The same with websites, the structure of a page is not always apparent in the
    design...'

  comment_content: Hi Emil:↵Excellent job!! and you have made me a Design-Content
    believer. So I guess I'll have to go back and clean up some code. I'm using Dieter
    Schneider's template and I have noticed some quirks.  I design on apache (from
    easyPHP install) and run our site on Linux, thought that was the problem? Maybe
    it's here?↵↵↵↵Best↵↵Paul

    short for something longer,'' ... I said &lt;abr&gt; because I thought acronym
    was a property of other elements... am I right?'

  comment_content: '[Editor: updated quiz to reflect errors]\n\nQ1. 3\nQ2. 2\nQ3.
    3\n\nQ4. 2 (abbr, not abr). And it''s important to remember that IE doesn''t support
    that element so you''ll need some kind of work around for it.\n\nQ5. Uhm, well.
    Styling the browser scrollbar can''t be done with CSS, and giving a 100% height
    on a element doesn''t work either. So both 1 &amp; 2.\n\nQ6. 3\n\nQ7. It''ll surely
    not let nr 1 pass since it''s spelled wrong. But I guess you meant nr 3 since
    it''s badly structured.\n\nQ8. 1\nQ9. 2\nQ10. 3 (waiting for css3...)\n\nNice
    quiz, even though there are some errors.'

  comment_content: '@Teddy: Thanks for you comments. \n\nQ4: you''re absolutely right,
    My idea here was that 1 should be the answer and abbr misspelled but I should
    have read up on the definitions first. I''ll change that right away.\n\nQ5: stupid
    me, a NOT too much there. Chaning.\n\nQ7: I''m right on that one though. No NOT
    in that question.'

  comment_content: 'Hi\n\nEmil: Do you mean "address" instead of "adress"? Otherwhise
    - what does adress mean?\n\nWhat does: "Q5: stupid me, a NOT too much there. Chaning."
    - "Chaning" mean?\n\nQuestion five: all of them. Scrollbars in IE, make div height
    to 100% and change the "line-height" property.\n\nWhy wouldn''t "display: inline-block"
    be valid CSS?\n\nQuestion ten: 2 and 3. There is no unit "en".\n\nQuestion eight:
    really number one? I''ve heard some stuff about tabs as well though.'

  comment_content: '@Henrik: Chaning = Changing... are you going to correct my spelling
    in the comments? :)\n\nQ5: No, setting scrollbars is NOT possible using "W3C’s
    CSS2". It''s possible using IE only code though.\n\nQ7: that spelling error rules
    out 1) but the question is still correct.\n\nQ8: don''t be silly :) tabs will
    never be controlled from the CSS.\n\nQ9: Read the question again. CSS2 is not
    CSS2.1\n\nQ10: True, should be ex... fixing.'

  comment_content: 'Will you post real answers to these? :)\nQ1: 3\nQ2: 2\nQ3: 3\nQ4:
    1 - pretty sure its &lt;acronym&gt;.\nQ5: I think it''s 2, because I know 1 and
    3 are possible for sure, and I remember I have trouble doing 100% div height before.\nQ6:
    3\nQ7: 2 - pretty sure Transitional lets thru font tags. (1 should be  &lt;address&gt;
    though)\nQ8: no idea, I''m guessing it''s 1, because tabs is browser-specific,
    and animating is pointless (JS for behavior).\nQ9: I think it''s 2?\nQ10: no idea,
    guessing 3..'

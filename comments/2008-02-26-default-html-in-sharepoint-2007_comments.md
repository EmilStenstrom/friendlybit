  comment_content: Wow. I believed Gartner when it said that SP was gaining a lot
    of points in this last version (magic quadrant for wcm). But for any client looking
    for a platform like this, the customization is essential. How can we explain in
    lame terms these huge issues? Stakeholders usually fall for the lazy coders arguments
    (pro M$) and the small visual gadgets... How do I explain this to a 8 year old
    kind of audience?\nAnyway, excellent article. Thanks for the great input.

  comment_content: Thank you for your contribution to the community on Sharepoint
    2007, Emil.\n\nThanks to your blogposts about that Microsoft product, I will really
    try to avoid the product if we're to ship any custom design Sharepoint installation
    to a customer.\n\nCode like this basically comes down to one thing - a back-end
    developer writes front-end code without really having a clue. A common misunderstanding
    at many, many companies today is any web programmer can write all the code necessary
    to fulfill the task.\n\nWonderful.

  comment_content: Thanks for sharing this. This really shows that Sharepoint 2007
    cannot be used in the public sector (in Sweden) without big investments (time
    or $). I wonder if MS have thought about this? This must have an big impact on
    MS. What government or municipality wants to pay extra money just to make the
    system accessible and support standards?

  comment_content: Thanks for your clarifying and explanatory articles on MOSS/Sharepoint,
    they're an invaluable resource!\n\nI can't fathom that a hack such as this even
    gets released. Where's their Quality Assurance, where's the performance, cross-browser
    and platform concerns, where is the accessibility (because what you show us is
    quite the opposite)?

  comment_content: I'm laughing so hard. This is THE funniest thing I've seen or heard
    in a long time. It tops this <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/shavecut"
    rel="nofollow">Forehead Shavecut</a> thing I found a few days ago. If you'd posted
    this on April 1, I certainly wouldn't have believed any of this. It just doesn't
    make sense why anyone would purposely create a program that <em>goes out of it's
    way</em> to make bad code... which means the makers of the program had to do extra
    work to make the users of the program do extra work. Huh?

  comment_content: It truly is remarkable isn't it? I keep telling myself, "this isn't
    THAT bad, is it?" and then I find some new horrible aspect of it. Yesterday I
    used a lowercase ASP.NET tag (ASP is case insensitive, so you should be able to
    do that), but found that MOSS added a new html element at the end, totally breaking
    everything. It's bad.

    for internal projects like intranets and collaoration systems this must have big

  comment_content: 'javascript: in handler attributes like onload works for either
    of two reasons:\n1) javascript: is interpreted as a label or\n2) it''s allowed
    for compatibility with stupid scripts.\n\nBut #1 would explain why this ever worked
    in the first place, so I''m leaning towards it.'

  comment_content: I agree on all points, Emil, and our article really emphasize why
    Cameron Moll's skinning is so impressive (at least by the looks of it).\n\nBut
    in this context it is important to point out that there are some community efforts
    trying to work around these issues, to some degree. I am thinking of Accessibility
    Kit for SharePoint (AKS) version 1.0, released in December last year. It claims
    to be a toolbox for creating web sites that conforms to WCAG 1.0 AA. It's a set
    of master pages, new controls and webparts along with technical documentation.
    No silver bullet, for sure. \n\nThis first version 1,0 is aimed only at WCM sites.
    Next version will take care of team sites (don't know about collaboration portals,
    though), they say. Hopefully, they be succeed - HTML compliance along with poor
    developer experience is SharePoint's weakest points, imho.\n\nLooking forward
    to see some of your customizations, Emil!

  comment_content: Great read! I was laughing out loud at onclick="javascript:this.href='#mainContent';"
    href="javascript:;" ... that's pure madness.\n\nThanks for taking the time to
    write this up. Hopefully someone (from MS) will listen.

  comment_content: '@Johan Dewe: Good catch. What MOSS really needs is lots of projects
    like that. They not only help the developers working (struggling) with MOSS right
    now, but also send a  powerful message to MS: "We need good interface code".\n\n@Aaron
    Schmidt: Thanks, but I doubt people from MS read this blog...'

  comment_content: '@Jens Wedin: MOSS has a much wider audience than sweden and the
    24webb guidelines, so I don''t think they affect MOSS that much. I might be wrong,
    but I''m not sure accessibility is that important in all countries...'

    installation of Sharepoint 2010. My guess: it''s better, but not anywhere good
    (in terms of html/js/css quality).'

  comment_content: There is a great improvements of quality of the markup in SharePoint
    2010. Although SharePoint 2010 doesn’t solve all web standards and accessibility
    related issues, it makes delivering accessible solutions easier than it was in
    MOSS 2007.

  comment_content: SharePoint 2010 has in fact made some progress in this direction
    but it is far from pretty. It has also introduced some new 'curiosities' such
    as the span tags that seem to have gotten lost. See <a href="http://jcapka.blogspot.com/2010/06/strange-spans-in-sharepoint-2010-team.html"
    rel="nofollow">my blog</a> about that one. I can't wait for SharePoint to run
    on the MVC engine, hopefully vNext.\n\nGreat post by the way!

  comment_content: Looking good man. Much better alignment of things. Clean layout.
    I like it already!\n\nA horizontal scrollbar is visible in 1024x768 mode though.\n\nKeep
    the great stuff up!

  comment_content: I think the old theme had a more personal feeling to it. More like
    you could feel that you were in someone's home.\n\nAnd RSS doesn't work anymore.

  comment_content: Hello Emil! Nice with a new style, maybe a bit too minimalistic
    for me but what I really like is the structure and the way you high lighten the
    comments.\n\nEven though you write very interesting material, it is often (like
    on many other good blogs) the discussion/comments about the current article that
    fill in the blanks and give you a different perspective on the area.\n\nKeep up
    the good work!

  comment_content: 'Interesting. I like the minimalism. I don''t necessarily like
    the fluid width: at full width the lines feel too long. And you might consider
    making the link to the feed more prominent.\n\nI do like the style you''ve used.
    Comments alongside the posts is great.\n\nKeep up the design and writing, both
    are great!'

  comment_content: The new layout is great; I had just noticed the longer comments
    on the previous post seemed to need more space :)\n\nNow, on to the "reward"...
    Ahem. The search button is only half-visible when it gets linewrapped down in
    a narrow window.\n\nHave you noticed that layouts tend to show if the author is
    primarily a programmer, a graphic designer or a markup &amp; style writer? This
    one says you're a front-end developer (a good thing, IMO ;) But I do miss the
    pictures a bit.

  comment_content: Looks really nice, good source and nice use of colors to show "importance".
    Though I think you should either remove the line at the very bottom of the comment
    box or make it thinner. It looks excessive to me as you already have the thick
    border running along the bottom of the page.\n\nBtw, any chance that we may see
    some sort of subscription or feed for the comments?\n\nI think I found a "misspelling"
    here <q cite="Emil">and some of you probably <b>which</b> I did sometimes</q>.
    You mean wish?

  comment_content: '@Exec: Great comments. Removed the line below the comments and
    fixed the misspelling.\n\nWordpress always generates a comment feed, just add
    /feed/ to the url of any article and you''ll get it. Of course that''s not enough
    here, so I added one link to the comment feed in the Comment heading, and another
    one in the footer below the article. Hope that''s ok.\n\nAlso fixed the problems
    you found on the html encyclopedia page by changing what HTML I used to something
    else than a definition list. It was strange anyways. I also styled the correct,
    incorrect and maybe classes.'

    width they don''t wrap on my screen. Might be that the buttons on your OS is wider.
    I''d like to fix that!'

    Well, never mind then. Although you can get a similar result if you increase the
    page text size. Firefox/Ubuntu, btw.

  comment_content: Nice! Perhaps a bit sparse, but it's very easy to read, and, as
    mentioned above, especially the comments.\n\nThe possible downside of having the
    comments next to the post is that it might draw some unwanted attention at the
    first initial read, i.e. people might read the comments before finishing reading
    the actual post.\n\nAside from that, good work!

  comment_content: Sorry, it just looks unfinished to me, just my opinion.  But judging
    by the other comments I'm in the minority.  Regardless, I'm here for the articles,
    not the eye candy :).\n\nJust curious... Is your headshot and short bio supposed
    to be up next to the FriendlyBit banner?  There seems to be a little open spot
    that would fit it nicely.  Then the top of the Comments box would line up with
    the top of the article.\n\nKudos on having the guts for such a major redesign!

  comment_content: '@Martin S: Feels rather strange... Would mess up the page stats,
    and what would google think of it? Feels too dangerous I think...\n\n@Adam Z:
    I see what you mean. The gap up there have been left out intentionally. I had
    it like that first, but letting some friends look at the page they had problems
    deciding where to start. So I made the header color more prominent, and moved
    the right column down, seemed to fix the usability stuff.'

  comment_content: 'Hi! ^_^ I thought I should comment some things about the new design...
    First of all, I really liked the other one and am sad to see it gone, I actually
    thought that one felt open (I so loved the sky image ^o^) but it''s your website.
    ;-) As for the new design... it''s really minimalistic, that''s for sure. Hey,
    I can dig minimalism, no problems, it''s just that... hm, well, like the content
    area feels so "white", void like. But then again, it can just be that it''s new,
    in contrast to your old design with a lot of details... But overall I think it''s
    a good design, don''t think otherwise. :-D\n\nWell, to the things about the design
    itself...\n\n* The corner images have a white background, while the main background
    is not.\n\n* "/* Safari needs to get html tag cleared */" intrigues me..?\n\n*
    This one I was actually going to bring to your attention when you had the old
    design up but didn''t get around to it. Since your site uses cookies, it is requiered
    according to swedish law, to inform the user about that but I have found no trace
    of such information. Why I was looking for it were because I was curious how you
    implemented it, trying to decide how I should implement it myself.\n\nMore info
    on the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency/Post- och Telestyrelsen''s website.\n\n*
    You have a more or less empty div with the id of "navigation"?\n\n* Why do you
    give the div containing the actual post an id based on what I would believe was
    the post number?\n\n* Hm, I''m thinking a little about that you have the label
    for the input fields after the fields themselves, is that not bad accessibility-/usabilitywise?
    I mean, if they were checkboxes/radiobuttons that would be expected but with ordinary
    text fields...\n\n* The strangest thing happens (Firefox 2) when I hover over
    the search input field; it moves 1 px to the left. But that is only if it is blurred,
    since it moves back upon blurring.\n\nNitpicking: Word is a program, word is a
    group of letters. ;-)\n\nAnyway, keep on blogging, I regularly visit to find some
    good and useful stuff. ^^'

  comment_content: I have not been here for a while, but I think your new look is
    great. The comment column (division) is easer to read. Great to see you put it
    on the right, the articles are very clear to read on the left. The website gives
    a more adult look now.\n\nThe look however is more business-like compared to the
    older look. The older look gave a cosy idea. I miss this a little bit. And smaller
    screens have to scroll horizontal I presume, but when this only for the comments
    it really doesn't matter.

  comment_content: Noticed some more strange things.\nThe popular articles page is
    empty and there's nothing specified for Email/MSN on the <a href="http://friendlybit.com/about/contact/"
    rel="nofollow">contact page</a>.\n\nAlso, if it's possible, the "Recent Articles"
    snippet should be changed to a "Popular Articles" snippet on the frontpage as
    you already have a large listing of recent articles there.

  comment_content: '@Peter Vigren: Big thanks for all your comments and suggestions.
    I''ve now gotten some time for fix the things you mention:\n\n* Corner images
    are now the right color. \n* Safari didn''t work with the bottom red:ish border
    as it should without a clear there.\n* About cookies: I really think it''s a silly
    law so I won''t put up any text about it. There''s much more important issues
    to warn about.\n* I fixed the empty navigation div with a little wordpress hack.\n*
    The post ID is used by some plugins I think (javascript targeting some specific
    posts), and is included in the default theme, so I just let it be there even though
    I don''t use it.\n* Strange mouseover in Firefox 2? Who uses that anymore? :P
    Doesn''t sound too serious though, so I''ll let it be.\n* I''ll have a look at
    the accessibility issue later this week, thanks for bringing it up.\n* Nitpick:
    Uppercased "Word" :)'

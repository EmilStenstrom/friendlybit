  comment_content: Obviously I don't know how MS will proceed, but my guess is that
    they will not do much about it. Probably let this issue slide; reason being it
    can be costy to implement a 'make everyone happy' solution.\n\n\nMy prediction
    is that MS will let it slide and let IE6 turn into what's happening with IE5 and
    at some point stop supporting it (i.e. IE5mac). Which seems to be a decent plan
    (not necessarily for the developers) for the next 3+ years.

  comment_content: You could always upgrade to IE7 and then keep older versions of
    IE as standalones:\n\n<a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone"
    rel="nofollow">http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone</a>\n\nWhen I was
    working with Windows, I had IE 4-7b1 on a single computer. Conditional comments
    don't work, unfortunately (the browser identifies itself as the highest installed
    version), but other than that it works like a charm.\n\nAlso, your comment entry
    box is <em>really</em> slow for me (like, less than a character a second). Not
    sure why, but I had to type this up in a text editor. (FF 1.5.0.2, Linux)

    link section on your site, it''s soo long in source and so short on the page ;)'

  comment_content: '@Coda Hale: It seems to work. It doesn''t feel much better than
    hacking IE7 to standalone though, in fact, what evolt has done is just that, hacked
    IE6 into standalone. If a group of skilled hackers can do it, why can''t Mircosoft
    put out a supported version?'

  comment_content: Another good solution would be to install a stand alone copy of
    IE6. They are already available as well as the previous versions.

  comment_content: This is definitely a problem that has been weighing on my mind
    for some time. However I think the answer may lie in simply finding the IE6 rendering
    engine skeleton, as oppose to the entire piece of software. I have <em>the rendering
    engine happily runs stand alone</em>.

  comment_content: '@Steve Tucker: Yes, I belive that IE6 standalone is the current
    best solution. What still feels bad is that it''s a hacked version by someone
    else than the IE Team. I''m sure they could make a standalone version themselves
    with some work. Support not needed. Thanks for your comment.'

  comment_content: it is 'cause MS does not care, just want's to cash in, they do
    not give a damn about developers and poor guys e.g. small companys who cannot
    afford prof. designers. i have to learn html and css by myself in spare time and
    it is laborous to get the same look and feel across the browser. \nbut did MS
    answer you? would be cuiros to read it.

  comment_content: hi emil,\nstrange move yes but it shows the attitude of global
    players. it is allways good to know what to have and expect from others (and form
    oneself).\nAs others already said, one should not neglect 90 % of MSIE users -
    at least when one depends on some kind of income to make a living.

  comment_content: Thank you for a good tutorial.I am from norway and i am a fresh
    webdesigner if i can call my self it.I have a poker site(mentioned as my website)
    that i am curently constructing.My goal is to use css strictly for all efects
    and content,avoiding java and flash as much as i can, and i want to have it as
    accesible as i can get it.I mess around with codes and learn the hard way at home
    but css is realy fun to work with,but sometimes it makes me confused.I got a few
    more good hints from reading your article and i will spread the news on this site
    to my friends.If i may i will also put a link to you on a webmaster page i have
    in plans for creating.Please feel free to wisit my site,i am so fresh in this
    game but i do agree on what you say in your article about a poker site and making
    sites acessible..If you have corrections and tips on my coding i am realy happy
    to be notified because i am looking for the best way to write a good code...\nThank
    you for shearing your knowledge.\nFrom geir ove in norway.

  comment_content: '@Geir Ove Roe: Always nice to hear that people find my articles
    interesting. I thank you for telling your friends and even linking to me. Thanks!\n\nLooking
    at your site I have a few comments: your code is already far superior to the top10
    in the <a href="/css/semantic-poker-template/" rel="nofollow">poker tutorial</a>.
    \n\n1) I see no &lt;h1&gt; in your code. Add a good title somewhere!\n2) Those
    rounded corners should be added with javascript instead of manually. Google for
    "nifty corners" and use that javascript instead of empty bold tags.\n3) Animated
    images distracts the reader from reading your text. I would use static images
    instead.\n\nGood luck with your site!'

  comment_content: 'Hi Emil,\n\nThanks for the introduction to CSS. I must say i am
    a bit distressed by it though as i got my 3 columns working but they will not
    align if you make their width 100% (ie: you have to keep total width at 99% to
    ensure they line up nicely)\n\nI have learnt the reason for this behaviour on
    <a href="http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/css/box-model/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/css/box-model/</a>
    and think you should point this out to your users.\n\nKind Regards\n\nAlex'

  comment_content: Just wondering when the next one is planned?\n\n\nI loved the Poker
    tutorial/guide as it made me realise a few things I hadn't thought about before.

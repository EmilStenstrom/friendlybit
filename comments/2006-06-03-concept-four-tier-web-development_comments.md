  comment_content: I have to take turns working in all four layers, but not always
    in order. I try to avoid it, but usually the Behaviour and Design require changes
    in the Structure, such as additional IDs, Classes or div/span tags.

  comment_content: '@Jesse Skinner: I must agree there, the separation between structure
    and design/behaviour is not as sharp as one would like. I''m waiting for the CSS3
    selectors to be better supported, that will save a lot of classing. \n\nFor behaviour
    we can always use some kind of CSS abstraction layer that lets us select tags
    in the DOM with the help of CSS.'

  comment_content: Emil - can you expand on the idea of a CSS abstraction layer? I've
    used the Behaviour.js library, which uses css selectors to add event handlers,
    but on a dynamic page this requires the DOM to be re-scanned after every change,
    which is a killer for performance.

  comment_content: '@Graham King: I''m not talking about code libraries here. This
    is just a way of thinking about what parts the client side is divided in. Javascript
    naturally belongs in the Behavoiur layer.'

  comment_content: Shouldn't be something called Interaction Layer? Where your website
    could interact with others (RSS, webservices, bla bla) which per see is not data
    or behaviour?

  comment_content: '@Adedeji Olowe: Good comment. Hmm... I think that goes outside
    of this client side model. Even though I can imagine creating RSS-feeds from javascript
    ;)\n\nA larger image of all the parts, both server-side and client-side would
    be nice, want to make one?'

  comment_content: It would be more fun to read about server-side tiers and n-tier
    development where there really <em>is</em> something to discuss!

  comment_content: very insightful, honest, summative and quick-read stuff. i can't
    even remember when was the last web-article i read without giving it up half-way.
    this in comparison was a breeze.

    I agree, the translators are terrable, probably has something to do with the verb
    being at the end instead of between the object and subject.'

  comment_content: That's a really nice way of looking at and the diagram at the bottom
    really helps to illustrate your way of thinking. Although there is really nothing
    new here for the seasoned developed, it makes for a good read none the less.

  comment_content: Nice bit of standards assessment! Behavior is also managed using
    CSS2. When CSS3 surfaces, the list of behaviors will grow. Also there are "tendencies"
    (I think they call them that, as they are intended to provoke certain, say, Javascript
    developments with native "unobtrusive" support). So perhaps Javascript belongs
    in a fifth catagory, with Ajax, Ruby, ASP, PHP, C and so on. We could unimaginatively
    call that web layer the Script layer. In the script layer, web development is
    set aside and platform development shuffles in. Javascript is an easily managed
    flirtation with server IT. However, it can be handily stressed that platform people
    are not fitting Javascript in browsers to web design, but rather to development
    of server technology. It's a handy thing that the browser apps tend to maintain
    script cultures in their architecture so that web developers aka designers can
    resource script per rada nada. Fives a handful, but there you go!

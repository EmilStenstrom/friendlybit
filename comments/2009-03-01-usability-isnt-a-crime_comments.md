  comment_content: In my eyes "Open Music" equals to Creative Commons licensing which
    I think is the future for many creators (<a href="http://www.nin.com/" rel="nofollow">Nine
    Inch Nails</a> is probably the best example of a successful "Open musician" to
    date). Another way to solve the problem is mentioned here Vem betalar?. Maybe
    we all should pay via our taxes?

  comment_content: 'I''m not sure I can agree.\n\nUsability <em>can</em> be a crime.
    Helping others commit a crime is illegal (i.e. making it easier for others to
    commit crimes).\n\nThe main difference between speaches and music/books is that
    speaches are usually only relevant around the time they are spoken.\n\nAnd some
    musicians and all (well, a vast majority) authors don''t want to or cannot perform.
    So who should pay them while working or when they''ve finished their work? The
    only entity that possibly could pay is the government, but wouldn''t that put
    all those people under the same category, and all would be payed equally (without
    caring about who''s more "popular" or "better").\n\nSo no, business model isn''t
    actually our problem, but if there actually doesn''t <em>exist</em> a good one
    (allowing free distribution) - then we''re back to the first step again.\n(I guess
    I have such a business model though: Authors and musicians could start to include
    ads in their works. That on the other hand would be a catastrophy, so I hope not)'

  comment_content: '@Jonathan Hedrén: Nice! I didn''t know that there were good examples
    of big artists that licensed their music freely. There will be much more of that,
    I''m sure. About taxes: Why should we? We don''t pay a tax to save the car industry
    from collapsing (they just said No to that), and we shouldn''t pay a tax to help
    the music industry.'

  comment_content: '@Dan Wolff: In this case, the helpers did not know of the specific
    crimes committed. It''s like organizing people, or helping them to network, something
    I don''t think should be illegal. ↵↵About paying authors: The fact is that the
    internet has made distribution dirt cheap. That means that everyone previously
    making money from distribution monopoly does have a problem. You''ve started to
    see newspapers with the same problem, without anyone going through hoops to find
    out how to pay them now when people find their news online instead. ↵↵An author''s
    performance is them writing a new book. That''s something they can do, and that''s
    what there''s demand for. If they "have to get paid" like you say (which is far
    from certain), I think that that''s where they should get their money. Again,
    any details of how it should work is actually not my problem, I can just describe
    how things have changed.'

  comment_content: '@Emil Stenström: Yes, I think they have to get paid. It should
    be possible to make a living as an author or musician.\nAnd there''s no demand
    for a book <em>until</em> it''s published, unless the author is already very famous.
    But I do agree that it would be good if authors mainly got paid when a book is
    published (perhaps not <em>only</em> then, but that that would be the main "salary").\n\nNewspapers
    have ads in them to finance their being - I''d hate to see that in books.'

  comment_content: '@Dan Wolff:  Yes, I think it should be <em>possible</em> to make
    money as an author or musician.  But I don''t see a threat to that.\n\nWhat is
    threatened is the "right" to make a life-long living out of a few years of creativity.  The
    few artists that seems to complain a lot seems to be the great artists of the
    80''s and early 90''s, while more recent artists are either embracing the Internet
    or are at least a lot less categorical.\n\nBasically, the "making money from a
    distribution monopoly" are seriously threatened, and artists that have signed
    long-term contracts with such monopoloys might not like that.  I don''t think
    other artists / authors / etc need to worry that much.\n\nThere will be people
    willing to pay for culture.  Maybe the prices will do down a bit -- maybe even
    by half -- but that still leaves more money to the actual artist than the big-label
    system of today.'

  comment_content: I find statements like this insulting:\n"Copyright holders protest
    and say that they “have to” get paid for what they produce. And that argument
    seems to work well with people, because hey, why shouldn’t they? (Real non-geeky
    people, not people like you)."\n\nbecause you are blatantly appealing to my ego
    by suggesting that if I agree with you I have more "nerd cred". Whatever...\n\nThat
    you think such childish rhetorical tactics will get by your reader makes me think
    you either have little respect for them, you don't know any better, or maybe you
    are so used to preaching to the quire that you don't know what a real argument
    looks like.\n\nI did not read the rest of your article, nor do I intend to.

  comment_content: '@Brendan Miller: I''m sorry you didn''t read the article. I actually
    added that parenthesis not to NOT insult people. My guess is that a bigger chunk
    of my audience does not agree with intellectual copyright laws. I guess it comes
    with being a programmer, and only seeing data (music, movies...) as 1''s and 0''s.
    Maybe that explains my wording?'

  comment_content: <blockquote>And that’s the challenge that the record industry should
    put all their power towards. Think of speakers instead of writers, how do they
    get money?</blockquote>\nThere's the rub for the record companies (RIAA's customers,
    so to speak). This path leads to more money for the artist, but the record company
    getting cut out or at least playing a much smaller role.\nYou no longer need millions
    of dollars worth of equipment to cut and mix music, just a computer and a special
    piece of software.\nYou no longer need to stamp out thousands of CDs and distribute
    them to record stores around the world. Just put the music on the web, offer to
    send a CD for a small fee, even allow higher quality music downloads (flac) for
    a small fee (uses more bandwidth).\nThe only thing the record company will be
    needed for, really, is promotion.

    not be read.  You call his argument childish, but I think it is actually your
    reaction which is far more childish.  Emil was not preaching to the choir, he
    was simply making an appeal to the majority of his audience.

  comment_content: 'They are doing their best to block everything in this world. Starting
    from IT companies, finishing with companies in the audio &amp; video world. It''s
    pretty clear for me that they would win money even if everything was for free
    for users, but they won''t ever accept this. It''s the normal spirit to chase
    money. Look for example at Avatar: it was a really basic simple solution to give
    it to users only in 3D format, right? And everybody said that you have to see
    it in 3D, as it''s great and so on...polluting, works great nowadays, especially
    when they chase $!'

    hey, why shouldn’t they? ↵↵      Its not about being geeky or non-geeky.The whole
    point is if a speaker gets paid on what he's reading, then the audience is "actually"
    listening to what he's reading and the writer has a right to get paid. No one
    denies that much piracy is going on and people do benefit from it, still its not
    a good thing.

  comment_content: Good review. Nice to see it from someone who is not familiar with
    the Apple way until the iPad.\n\nI myself use iPhone at work and Android at home.
    I write my apps as HTML5 apps and wrap them with for example PhoneGap since that
    does not violate 3.3.1 just yet.\n\nAn Android-based tablet is more interesting
    for me and I don't mind waiting for it.

  comment_content: It has always bothered me how annoying it was to browse through
    the App Store / iTunes on my iPhone (even when I'm using a WiFi connection).  It's
    just not optimized.\n\nGreat review -- a real life review is helpful.  I've been
    unsure of whether I would have a use for an iPad.  It sounds like the iPad is
    used for ... exactly what I use my iPhone for.  Just a nicer experience.  \n\nFrequently
    I use my iPhone at home (sounds dumb when I have laptops around) just because
    it's easy to just take out and look something up.  Not sure I'd do the same with
    a larger iPad.\n\nNice review, very helpful for folks like me (iPhone owners,
    not sure about getting an iPad).  Right now it looks like I'll wait for my next
    toy (maybe the new iPhone)

  comment_content: Sure, it looks great next to an old banana but how does it look
    next to Heidi Klum?

  comment_content: I think it is also worth mentioning the e-book reader functionality\n\nWhile
    it doesn't work as well as other readers in sun light it is still useful.

  comment_content: '@Adrian: Yeah, I guess that I should review that too, but it seems
    books from iTunes are geographically restricted somehow. I can''t find the iBook
    app, and the App Store does not work from within the iPad itself. That means no
    review from me.'

  comment_content: Its great to see this independent review for ipad. We in India
    are yet to get it so we can decide on taking it or not based on such good user
    reviews.

  comment_content: Great review Emil. I love the picture of the old banana! Are you
    comparing an iPad to a rotten banana???\n\nI recently bought my first Apple product
    in a long time, an iPhone. My reactions are much the same as yours. I love the
    device, but it really irks me being locked into Apple's ecosystem. I was surprised
    to discover I couldn't even begin using my iPhone until I synced the device to
    my iTunes account, and doubly surprised to discover that it is only possible to
    sync the device with a single computer. Nevertheless, I do believe that the pros
    outweigh the cons.\n\nI think the mobile web space will be really interesting
    a few years from now, once Android has is firmly established. Android phones already
    outsell iPhones, but Apple still have the mindshare.

  comment_content: I use an iPad to read my feeds. For me it's more a gadget than
    a really useful tool.

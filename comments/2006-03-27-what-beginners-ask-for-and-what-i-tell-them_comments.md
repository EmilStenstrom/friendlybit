  comment_content: Not sure where to post this question so feel free to move it.\n\nI
    *just* started experimenting with CSS and your site helped me get going -- now
    I need even more training to get all this stuff figured out!  I noticed that my
    pages only worked properly in IE 6; Netscape 7.1 &amp; Netscape 8 only showed
    the .css page, not the .html page.  I had to put Netscape 8 into IE mode to get
    it to work properly.  Did I do something wrong?  Is there a way to force CSS implementation?  Why
    bother if it's not supported across browsers?

  comment_content: Yes, I've read all of your CSS pages :-)  I discovered that the
    problem occurs when the .html page is opened from disk.  When opened from a web
    server everything works fine.

  comment_content: As a consultant and professional geek, I have always preferred
    frames &amp; tables over CSS. Having read innumerable tutorials on CSS, I can
    now say none of them did near the justice to explaining the power of style sheets
    that this site does! Only now I have to go back and change tons of code. Thanks.

  comment_content: Thanks for the clarification on class and id selectors. Went to
    EFNet to look for a CSS group and could not find one anywhere. Can you recommend
    another forum to ask for help?

  comment_content: '@Eric: If you connect to the EFNet network with a IRC client like
    <a href="http://www.mirc.com/" rel="nofollow">mIRC</a> you can join the channel
    #css and find help there.  I know the group exist, it has over 150 users.\n\nIf
    that fails you, you can try <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets?lnk=gschg"

  comment_content: I completely agree with the validation argument that it is useful
    in terms that it pinpoints and highlights any spelling or tag mistakes. So its
    a good feature in my opinion. Coming to the Accessibility thing the four examples
    given can be of much help. CSS altogether offers much.

  comment_content: I agree. The feeling when everything snaps into place and you know
    intuitively that you've managed to find a minimal and semantically correct html
    structure and the simplest possible css is really great. You just don't get that
    feeling after a day knee deep in nested tables and ugly hacks.

  comment_content: 'Ahh.. \nThe memories, the memories :)\n\nWhat finally won me over
    to standards was actually a combination of several things...\nFirstly the "it
    must be a way to do this better"-feeling you describe started growing on me back
    in ''99 or so after a period of teaching basic HTML (Transitional without much
    attention to details other than what worked "better" i.e. browser-independent
    in the browsers of that period. - NS4 was among them - GAH). \n... and then Zeldman
    published <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/issues/99" rel="nofollow">issue #99
    of ALA</a> - WOW!\n\nSecondly back in ''99 or so I had a period in my career that
    led me into studying the innards of XML  - and I suddenly discovered that the
    DTD:s of the then proposed standard "XHTML" where actually understandable and
    that the "Strict" variant of that language actually was quite clean and logical...
    That feeling lay dormant an grew for a while due to some career twists, but when
    ALA (Zeldman again of course) published the article "<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/betterliving/"
    rel="nofollow">Better living through XHTML</a>" in the spring of ''02 about the
    same time I accidently stumbled upon a certain domain name at nunames, that was
    all she wrote - I realised that XHTML and CSS was a perfect match for me, and
    don''t think I''ll ever forget that blissful feeling :)\nSo from that moment on
    I was sold enough to start to humbly advocate standards - and that feeling have
    been driving me ever since...\n\n... and I really think  the method "read standards
    related web magazines and blogs" could work for almost anyone with a basic interest
    of getting over that "it should be able to do better"-feeling :)'

  comment_content: I had an online bookstore (aside from a site development-with-tables
    shop). I tweaked it every three months. I hated having to edit every page. I found
    the CSS p attribute and fonts; that was very cool. I then found an article about
    using CSS for presentation; that was exceptionally cool. I purchased "Designing
    with Web Standards" (of which <em>web standards</em> meant nothing to me).\n\nI
    found CSS so much more simple than tables.\n\nYears later, after seduction by
    Malarkey articles with his Ian Dury references, I discovered <strong>Web Standards</strong>
    philosophy.\n\nIt's a very simple precept.

  comment_content: 'The same story - I started out with frames, tables, javascripts,
    hacks galore because that´s what I found every time looking under the hood when
    the big guys had performed their magic. But the combined effect of Zeldman´s Designing
    with web standards, Eric Meyer´s On CSS, Zen garden, WaSP and ALA won me over
    willingly, and with real relief I got rid of all the obsolete junk, never to look
    back. It´s like Karajan said of the CD back in 1983: "All else is gaslight". Now
    I can´t believe my eyes when I see high profile web sites remade as if it still
    were 1995!'

  comment_content: I began to write HTML in 2000 or so, wrote my first "align=center"
    websites and so on, copied cool and bright table designs which were popular for
    QuickBasic RPG developers (like RPG DX back then).\n\nI didn't understand what
    I copied, but the table stuff caused more problems than it solved because it was
    so hard to edit a whole website's design. \n\nThen I learned PHP and how to get
    data out of databases, then I discovered that my graphics skills sucked, hence
    my graphical bordered boxes looked rather ugly, yeah, then I started thinking
    about another way and discovered ALA and other websites concerning web design
    (I never knew that somehting like that existed!), that was about three years ago,
    I think, and since then I improved my understanding of web standards, starting
    with the doctype rules of XHTML 1.0 Transitional, then advanced to strict mode
    (which took me a lot of time since I didn't understand why it was so... strict).
    I followed the masses, so to speak, without knowing what I really did for a long
    time. \n\nMy conciousness or web-savvy-ness grew exponentially during the last
    14 months, and now I'm really proud of understanding the principles, being one
    of the level 4 CSS coders (I think it was level 4, but I'm not sure - the one
    preceding the "inventor level"), at least in my own opinion.\n\nYeah, and nowadays
    I'm 19, develop web pages in my spare time and think about how in the name of
    god I will ever be able to convince other people, like customers, that I walk
    a way that's "more right" than the old one :)\n\nAt least a friend of mine, a
    designer, begins to adopt my principles just because my stuff works an his didn't
    :) That's probably the only way. Making things work.

  comment_content: Since I guess I'm the youngest here, I have never coded a table
    layout.\n\nIt started with framesets and applets. Then onto CSS, around year 2002...
    ALA became interesting to me during the spring 2003, with its mind-bending "sprites",
    "faux columns" and "fuzzy drop down shadows".\n\nThe tables were everywhere duing
    2003, and my CSS learning rate wasn't really that high in the start - mostly because
    I used Internet Explorer.\n\nBtw - it's fun to find Björn Thomasson on this page
    (hi there!) - I worked out at the same kayaking club as him when I was ~11 years.
    He actually introduced me to HTML. (of course very non-semantic HTML 3, but non-the-less)\n\nA
    bit off-topic perhaps, but it's fun to find him here ;). And look at me now -
    got my own web development company.

  comment_content: For me, it was a feeling of new professionality that came with
    web standards. Not having to think in tables anymore when designing. Also, the
    concept seemed very logical to me. And last but not least, the beauty of the sites
    fascinated me.

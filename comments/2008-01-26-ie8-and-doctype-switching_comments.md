  comment_content: <blockquote>Assuming IE8 is as good as the other browsers, and
    this isn’t unreasonable, this group of sites won’t break either.</blockquote>\nUnless
    you use the html4 doctype or xhtml (no?).

  comment_content: '@Trn: Thanks for pointing that out. I added the following: <blockquote><p>If
    you targeted IE7 with your conditional comment, IE8 will not get that fix, breaking
    these type of sites. Well, unless IE8 will execute IE7 conditional comments, when
    that engine does the rendering. "</p></blockquote>'

  comment_content: '@Martin, maybe. But it''s still the developers, even the standard
    aware ones, who will suffer because of this.\n\nReally good article, Emil. It
    works as a good summary of last week''s flamethrowing.\n\nIMHO, It wouldn''t be
    that bad if local intranets should be offered an official standalone installation
    package of IE6-7 instead. How would it look with "Compatible with IE6"-buttons
    on webaites? :D Backwards.'

  comment_content: I'm really hoping your prognostication that IE8 will execute IE7's
    conditional comments proves true. Otherwise, I'm taking my code and going home!

  comment_content: I'm guessing the reason they didn't reach out to the engineering
    community for ideas is because of their arrogance; ugh.

  comment_content: Well IE8 is a step forward from 7.  But it still has a ways to
    go to catch up with the others.  But at least IE is on their way.

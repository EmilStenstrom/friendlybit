  comment_content: I consider it childish having a grudge against Microsoft and things
    they did ~10 years ago (Windows ME). I can't really think of any despicable things
    they've done since then. It's really a whole different company today working actively
    with the open source movement and giving lots of love to the developer community.
    (node.js on Azure, jQuery intellisense and CDN hosting, open source Orchard CMS,
    to mention a few)\n\nMicrosoft today is not an evil company. But some will bear
    grudge against it until the day they die.

  comment_content: '@Mikael Lundin: Did you check the kind of bashing they get on
    the sites I linked to? That''s today. The good parts just don''t show up there,
    even though they probably should. Microsoft should be there, not just stick to
    places where people that already like them hang.'

  comment_content: Microsoft had been widely used since then that is why I can't imagine
    it as an evil company. I'm sure they've been doing damn hard to regain its reputation.

  comment_content: Have you found your devil, it's easy attribute everything to him.
    The people on Digg, Reddit or Hacker News will always be picking at straws to
    find evil in everything MS does. I doubt that anyone outside their circles listens
    or even cares.\nThose opinions won't reach the every day Windows/Office user.
    That is where Microsoft need their influence, and I think they've got back a lot
    of credibility with Office 2010 and Windows 7.

  comment_content: '@Mikael Lundin: You seem to have misunderstood what I''m trying
    to say here. It''s not if MS is good or evil, it''s that they are <strong>perceived</strong>
    as such by a big part of the tech crowd. That''s a fact. And it does effect ordinary
    Windows/Office users, see my arguments in the article.'

  comment_content: About your points; I think their already have done much in the
    areas of point 1 and 3. \n\nI was especially happy about how they handled the
    "jailbreaking" of windows phone 7. Let's see if it lasts.

  comment_content: What about beginners and business users? They are both heavily
    influenced by by tech users. Beginners because they ask others for advise before
    buying their computers and software.\nI wouldn't say I'm a tech user but as a
    proponent of Mac I was asked by a beginner (after troubleshooting his Windows
    display driver update for an hour) what computer I would recommend.  He was all
    ears. Point is that tech users are Mac users and so I would agree they need to
    start appealing\nto them on a new level.

  comment_content: Microsoft has earned its bad reputation over and over again. Microsoft
    had to be dragged kicking and screaming into compliance with web standards. They
    wanted everyone to use Internet Explorer, so they went off and created their own
    proprietary code that screwed with every other browser. We're still trying to
    overcome the slowdowns that caused in our work processes and in the general evolution
    of the Web.\n\nI wouldn't say they've turned that around, exactly, but what they
    have done in the past few years to improve IE means a whole lot more to me than
    anything they can say. I stopped listening to their hype a long time ago. Show
    me, don't tell me.

  comment_content: Too bad Microsoft has to work so hard just to overcome their own
    stupid PR mistakes. These tactics were so effective in the early years, but I
    don't believe they will ever really catch up.  That tech crowd they have alienated
    is not going to forget anytime soon, no matter how many "community managers" they
    hire to make nice.\n\nRobert

  comment_content: It's funny how Microsoft screws up and it blows up in their face,
    yet when Apple lets things slip, it works in their favor.

  comment_content: This article makes it look like all "Tech Users" match the behaviour
    contained in it, i consider myself a "Tech User", currently on my masters in cs,
    and working as a web application developer, and i do not think Microsoft or any
    of its recent products is bad. Because im a web developer i tend to wince when
    someones mentions ie6 or ie7, but its not entirely Microsoft fault people dont
    update to ie8 or ie9.\nI know a lot of the "Tech Users" mentioned in this article,
    usually are linux fans, i know few "Tech Users" that would chose a Mac for anything
    other than browsing the web and going to class with it, except for the Mac fans
    in my workplace, that have a huge Mac just to have it run a windows virtual machine
    on a much smaller screen next to it :P.\nIm an active user (and fan) of the windows
    7 OS, love theyr office suite (far superior to any other productivity software
    available), and generally consider theyr Software good, sure they make some mistakes
    (Windows ME, Windows Vista), but they seem to learn from them and allways come
    back with something great (Windows 7), plus, they seem to have learned to use
    the power of the comunity, just look at the kinect case.

  comment_content: Personally I'm not a fan of Microsoft, I'm a Mac user and I'm happy
    with it that way, even if Microsoft improved their product ten fold, it would
    take a lot for me to convert back.\n\nThe product to me is the most important
    thing and bad experience over the years has led me to put my faith in Apple products
    over Microsoft.

  comment_content: '@Carlos: A very good point indeed. Far from all tech users are
    affected by the slashdot (et al) negative news about Microsoft. I myself use a
    Windows machine at home so I am obviously not that contaminated by general tech
    opinion :)'

  comment_content: Well they give away free software for students through the Microsoft
    Academic Alliance which saved me bundles of money during my studies. Had Office,
    Vista Business and SQl server completely free. Maybe they should be praised for
    helping people get into the IT industry although they are only trying to create
    brand attachment with students who they hope will buy there software in the future.

  comment_content: i strongly believe it is horrible to judge Microsoft for things
    they did over a decade ago when Apple is currently doing the same things and being
    praised for it? How is this just?

  comment_content: It is funny how Apple always seems to be mentioned. The article
    does not even mention Apple, I thought it was about Microsoft?\n\nHowever, I agree
    completely. If more Tech people with huge impact by tweeting and writing blog
    posts were writing about all GOOD and GREAT stuff Microsoft put out, there would
    be a change in the air coming.\n\nI personally could imagine myself talking about
    stuff I like about the .NET platform, since I use and work well with C# and .NET
    MVC. I feel good about Nokia+Win Phone 7 since it could become a good alternative
    for Tech people who want a really good phone and could not find it in any Android
    device or an iPhone. \n\nSince I will be developing native apps for WP7 I could
    see myself talk and write about the importance of making Titanium extend their
    services to WP7 too.\n\nI could do that, if Microsoft managed to inspire me.

  comment_content: Microsoft's downfall is in its PR...it's products are not horrible.
    I actually like Windows 7 to be honest, but that's just me. A PC is always my
    choice over a Mac because I don't like Apple's closed-system policy.

  comment_content: '@Belinda: I agree with you a little, MS does not have great PR
    and Windows 7 isn''t bad at all. I have used Windows since Windows 1 and use Windows
    7 today, on the face of it Windows 7 works well but, Windows and Office are polished
    as they''re the cash cows of MS and that''s the problem most of their other products
    are very average. I manage 1500 Win 7 PCs on a daily basis with the latest MS
    servers and it just about works. Is this good enough?\n\nNow lets talk Apple,
    I don''t have a Mac but my family members do, Apple does have a closed system
    in some regards because this is the ideal if you want things to work the very
    best they can. MS and Apple have different approaches and I personally think people
    are fed up of Windows, patching, virus, buggy etc. Apple own it end to end and
    this does work better. If I didn''t need Windows for work I''d switch today!'

  comment_content: '@Anders - I agree with you about how Apple seems to find their
    way into almost any article these days - even those focused on Microsoft :)\n\nRegarding
    the proposed suggestions for microsoft, while they seem well thought-out and realistic,
    there is an element of letting the inmates run the asylum.\n\nApple''s way of
    telling the market what it wants rather than listening seems to trump the suggested
    approach, no?'

    like Apple.

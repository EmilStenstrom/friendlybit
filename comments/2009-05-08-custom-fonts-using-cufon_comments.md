  comment_content: Thanks for this recommendation. I have never used custom fonts
    in the past and I really want to stay away from Flash. I checked some demos with
    Cufón and it is looking good. But one usability drawback I see directly is confusion
    when you want to select text with the cursor ...\nTry selecting the bottom example
    text:\n<a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/articles/cufon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cameronmoll.com/articles/cufon/</a>\nComments
    on that?

  comment_content: '@Jim: That''s how it works. Firefox thinks it''s rendering an
    image, not text. So it''s not selectable. It''s certainly not a perfect solution,
    but it''s good a compromise for the moment.\n\nMaybe you could work around that
    issue by figuring out why people are selecting your text? And make that task unnecessary.
    Do they want a title for their tweet? Then make tweeting your stuff easier instead.'

  comment_content: Ah, that's explains it. It actually is selectable (I tried) but
    it looks like it is not.\n\nAs for me for example I usually select main headings
    of articles to use as anchor texts for links which I use for sources at the bottom
    of my articles. Yes, Twittering would be another example. Another example is delicious
    in which you perhaps copy and paste a certain sentence or two.\n\nWell, I would
    not really recommend it but for logos or such I guess it would work fine.\n\nActually
    people should not forget to style it with CSS as well for those that don't read
    JavaScript as I guess without JS it will just be a plain h1 or whatever element
    used.

  comment_content: When I reviewed Cúfon a couple of months ago I too noticed I was
    unable to mark text. Images are better in that area, since the alt text can go
    along in some cases (I do prefer Cúfon, though, since it still got more cons regarding
    progressive enhancement).\n\nI remembered having trouble with custom fonts on
    links too, but I could remember wrong.

  comment_content: Yea, a lot of talk about this Cufón thing going round on Twitter
    recently. I'll give it a try over the w'end - cheers.\n\nAgree with your logic.
    TBH I've never made a typeface, and until that day, once I appreciate the time
    and effort that goes into making them, I will have the attitude of take, steal,
    pillage unfortunately :[\n\nPerhaps if we get to the stage where everyone is taking,
    stealing, and pillaging the world might start making their own typefaces INSTEAD
    of stealing them.\n\nGood to see you swearing in your posts Emil, you're human
    after all :P\n\nL

  comment_content: '@Jim Westergren: The good thing with cufon is that it reacts to
    CSS styling. My example was for a logo, where half the text was red, and half
    was white. Wrapping a span around the first part and setting the color through
    CSS worked fine. So I would say Cufón encourages proper CSS styling too. Even
    setting a little padding on that inner span worked well.\n\n@Anders Ytterström:
    I''m using it for links, and it seems to work well. I know they recently added
    support for :hover styles, was that your issue?\n\n@Lewis Litanzios: About pirating
    fonts. Yes, direct linking would make it easier to do, just as easy as it is to
    steal an image. I can imagine discussions when the first browser came out, about
    images being easily copiable from the browser cache. Automatic piracy? Gosh!'

  comment_content: <b>And that’s the whole reason why we don’t have cross-browser
    fonts on the web today.</b>\nSeems to imply that it is all Microsoft's fault.
    But as someone who has followed the debate about font-linking very closely, I'm
    puzzled as to how you came to that conclusion and not the other way around - that
    is the fault of the other browser makers to NOT implement linking to EOT in addition
    to linking to TTF and OTF files that is holding things up.\nEOT has been submitted
    to the W3C as an open spec. It has existed in IE for over ten years and is well
    tested. It is a compressed file format and therefore offers something TTF/OTF
    files do not.\nThis whole problem is very easily solved. Simply support EOT alongside
    TTF and OTF. What's wrong with that? In that way, browsers could support free
    fonts and paid fonts, too.\nThe real problem seems to be that this approach does
    not make some kind of a political statement and does not "stick it" to Microsoft
    and allow you and others to offer an incomplete and knee-jerk interpretation that
    makes Microsoft out to be the bad guy.\nIf I'm wrong, please tell me how.\nBTW
    - I've looked at Cufon very carefully. It's a very promising approach to text-replacement.
    Developer Simo Kunnen has done a great job. By all means, check it out.

  comment_content: This is interesting.  I have heard of some different ways to use
    different fonts on your website, such as using JavaScript.  But I have never heard
    of Cufón.  Good to know.  I've always been asked "Why can't we use a different
    font?"

  comment_content: '@Richard Fink: I did not mean to blame Microsoft historically,
    just right now. All major browsers have implemented direct linking to TTF/OTF
    files. Except Microsoft. \n\nEven though you could disregard the terrible tools
    that exist to create EOT files, there are two solutions to cross browser fonts:
    Either everyone else switch to EOT, or Microsoft implement direct linking to TTF/OTF
    (or as you say, support both, that''s step two).\n\nThat''s why I want to push
    Microsoft to act, it''s either them, or all the others.'

  comment_content: 'Oh, and one more thing: Through HTTP-level compression (gzip)
    you can get almost as good compression of ttf fonts as with eot.'

  comment_content: I fully agree fonts should, when readable, be free to use on the
    web. Companies nowadays use own fonts for their company name and they should be
    able to use that font when this is familiar to their customers.\n\nI didn't know
    about Cufón. Thanks for the tip! Hope IE will get more sense in the future, they
    better do otherwise they will get pushed away by Firefox and upcoming Google Chrome.
    But I guess most FF users won't leave a tear when IE looses some of their dominance.
    :p\n\nAt the moment I'm busy trying to learn some Jquery for website effects,
    also to learn some first Javascript. Hope you'll write an article about this some
    time, Emil!

  comment_content: Awesome!!  I have been using sIFR - and it is really slow - I will
    def give this a try.\n\nI am sorry - what were they thinking when they built the
    web. It is pretty darn funny that today with all the things that can be done,
    full screen video, rich media, animation - that we still are designing with verdana.\n\nsIFR
    is still too slow to replace body text - this should be job one for the web code
    overlords.

  comment_content: We're using CUFON on a new site. Working great, although be aware
    there is basic CSS that is not supported, e.g. text-decoration style for ALL IE
    browsers! This one threw me for about an hour before I reread the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about"
    rel="nofollow">wiki</a>. Also, once you start using selectors to identify specific
    elements/classes, browser support becomes less consistent. Still trying to get
    my ".use_cufon" class to render in IE!

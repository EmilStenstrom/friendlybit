  comment_content: 'This is exactly what Eric Meyer does on his blog www.meyerweb.com,
    and the reason I''ve used it a lot for the last couple of years. \n\nMy rationale:
    If Eric Meyer uses it, there is probably a reason as to why it''s put in that
    way.\n\nThanks for pointing me to Owen Brigg.'

  comment_content: '@Jesper: I would say that it''s a good thing because Owen tested
    in in that many browsers and saw that it works rather than that Meyer uses it.
    But I agree with your point there :)'

  comment_content: I use the "bulletproof" method as recommended by Dan Cedarholm
    (base keyword then percentage) and have had great results. I have never experienced
    a problem with Opera either. The only drawback is having to give IE5.x one size
    smaller keyword.\nI often wonder why this method is rarely mentioned in these
    discussions.

  comment_content: When I want consistent results, I mostly use %, pretend that the
    base font size is 16px, and use my calculator to get the right sizes. If I want
    to change the font size from 16px to 14px, I calculate 14/16 = 87.5%. If I then
    want to change the font size from 14px to 12px, that gets 12/14 ? 85.7143%. It
    seems to work quite well as far as I can tell.

  comment_content: I use 62.5% in body which sets font to 10px and than I can use
    ems, like 1.2em is equal 12px.\nI am not sure if this is best way but works fine
    for me.

  comment_content: I don't doubt that a lot of people have found these techniques
    useful. But I've yet to get any of them to work. I've even been able to demonstrate
    that, at least in Firefox 3 and Safari 3 on my Mac and with regard to typography
    only, 1px is equal to about 1.2px. (No, that's not a typo.)\n\nSo I continue to
    scour the net for a technique that will allow me to reliably take a designer's
    pixel- or point-based size and render it in -- well, anything. I'd settle for
    bloody pixels, if they worked. They don't. (They never have, actually. I proved
    it eight years ago by doing screenshots in IE, Netscape and Opera across different
    system font sizes and screen resolutions. Pixels were the least consistent of
    the three methods I tried (points, percentage and pixels). Pixels weren't pixels
    then, either, it just wasn't as crazy as it is now.)\n\nI'm sure you all think
    I'm a crank by now, but the thing is, I've been driven a little insane by all
    of this.

  comment_content: '@eric: Good to hear that you keep pushing the limits, striving
    for pixel-perfect designs. From what I hear, very few interface developers have
    the stamina to keep trying to get pixel-perfect designs to work. I have stopped
    long time ago, and instead try to determine whether or not the differences destroy
    the design or not. Works well for me.'

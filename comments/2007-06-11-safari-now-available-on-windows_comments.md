  comment_content: Maybe its just the developers I interact with, but I rarely see
    them on Windows. It would be interesting to see how that gap looks (although hard
    to measure).

  comment_content: Unfortunately the beta seems so buggy that it is completely unusable
    (at least on my machine, running Win XP SP2 Media Center).

  comment_content: From what I've heard it does some really bad things to your system,
    breaking even Quicktime and possibly going so far as to replacing components.
    That's too bad, I was really excited to get an opportunity to test my sites in
    Safari without bribing Mac friends or using those browser shot sites. :P

  comment_content: I've been using Safari for about 6 months now, and its really influenced
    my design process. I used to design for Firefox first; now I design for Safari
    first.\n\nI expect Safari for Windows will be pretty awful for awhile (anyone
    remember IE for Mac?); we'll have to see how committed Steve and company remain
    to the project.

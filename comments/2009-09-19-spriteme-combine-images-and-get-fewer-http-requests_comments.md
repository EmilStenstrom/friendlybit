  comment_content: 'make sure to use your sprite correctly aswell .sprite {background-image:
    url(sprite.png;} .sprite-foo { background-position:...;} .sprite-bar { background-position:...;}\n\ninstead
    of .sprite-foo { background: url(sprite.png) ...;} .sprite-bar { background: url(sprite.png)
    ...;}  because only safari is smart enough to request your sprite 1 time in the
    last case, even if you use expire headers.'

  comment_content: '@Nicolas: I just looked breifly at smartsprites and it think it''s
    just too much work. Manually annotating your CSS file with things the computer
    can calculate for you? SpriteMe does all those calculations for you. Only thing
    I really want is a commandline version... Thanks for the tip though!'

  comment_content: You can and should get the best of both worlds, maintainability
    AND the fewer HTTP requests that result from combining the CSS files. How? Make
    the combining part of your site build process that you go through when releasing
    a new version of your site. \n\nDon’t have a site build process? Then you have
    bigger problems, or, it could be said, smaller problems, since your current scale
    probably means you don’t need to worry about boosting performance in this manner.

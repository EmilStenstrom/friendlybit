  comment_content: This is a very good argument! I often show sites on projectors
    and blame them for fad quality. \n\nMaybe my sites are bad? \n\nI´ll make a post of
    this on my site soon, thanks!

  comment_content: Page zoom is a bless! At least when it comes to the problem with
    resolution-independent presentation.\n\nColors and navigation friendly designs
    is still a subject worth mentioning more, though. A good call would perhaps be
    to first include the screen stylesheet to both screen and projection, and then
    include a projection stylesheet which tweaks the design a bit (add more contrast,
    exaggerate hover and focus events, make link more visible and increase their click
    areas ...) \n\nCan't wait to being able to play around in media queries for real
    production usage!

  comment_content: Mmmm.... Good point. I just discoverd my websites background goes
    well enlarging the website, but when I put it on 75%, my background moves to the
    right. Thanks to my used css...\n\nWhat I mostly do to test for color blind people
    is making a print screen and after this turn this to black/grey/white in Photoshop
    to look at the contrast/how readable it is.\n\nBut not everyone has a beamer in
    their household. Should we put a light in our screen to look at the brightness
    at that time?  ;)\n\nOther thing I still struggle with after reading your article,
    should we still think about small screens 800x600? And how do we know how much
    users still have small screens using internet? Or should we assume most people
    have 1024 screens?

  comment_content: '@Jan: I''m trying to figure that out too. My current guess is
    that flexible width down to 800 pixel wide screens, is the globaly optimal zolution.
    But that''s kinda tricky to get right (compared to fixed width)...'

    And how do we know how much users still have small screens using internet? Or
    should we assume most people have 1024 screens?</blockquote>\nIf you care about
    accessibility and usability, design for 800×600. There are a lot of people still
    using screens that size. There are a lot of people who have larger screens but
    choose not to run their browser window maximised. There are a lot of people who
    have larger screens but have a sidebar open so can't see the full 1024px.\n\nPS
    - Kudos to you for using × rather than x :-)

  comment_content: '@Emil, @Stevie\nGood point Stevie D! Mostly favourites are still
    open with older version IE users, who are still there. I have some brainstorm
    about this.\n\nSuppose these IE 6 users have small screens, then according <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp"
    rel="nofollow">w3school browser statistics</a> partially about 17% (or less of
    course, maybe 10%) might still own a smaller screen. That''s still a large group
    to reach.\n\nFurther I think it is important for who the website is. To reach private
    persons you should, I think, have 800×600 scaled websites or flexible ones (Until
    the screens get a lot cheaper by the current recession, but I see computers drop
    in prices, not screens yet).\n\nFor business websites for other business websites
    you might use 1024. I assume business are well facilitated with nice larger screens.\n\n@Emil,\n\nGood
    to read a new article from your hand, you have to wait sometimes for the next
    one, but at least they have good thoughts/content!'

  comment_content: Hi Emil! I've been one of the 1000 for a year or so, and would
    be one of the 100 if it wasn't for the fact that I seldom have anything useful
    to add to your always well-written posts.\n\nTurning Friendly Bit into a community
    sounds like an exciting idea, though I wouldn't want you to ditch the current
    format completely. Perhaps some of the articles you write (the ones that are more
    about information than opinion) can be wikified. I still think it would be best
    if you wrote the first revision of each article, though. A bit conservative perhaps,
    but still.

  comment_content: I would agree with Jesper in the respect that having "too much"
    community features may take away from your personal style of writing, and unless
    done cautiously could start cramming the site with too much content. However I
    do like the idea of combining other opinions and sharing ideas. Maybe start small
    with a simple feature and build off of that creatively and slowly see how each
    is accepted.

  comment_content: Jag har läst din blogg i några månader nu. Jag har ingen stor erfarenhet
    av kodning, bara ett gäng mindre oklara projekt.\n\nOmarbetningen till community
    ger lite blandade känslor. Mer artiklar och innehåll att läsa är ju såklart positivt,
    men jag är lite orolig för kvaliteten på innehållet. Att jag läser just din blogg
    beror på att det som står är rakt igenom vettigt. Jag tycker att någon form av
    kvalitetskontroll borde finnas, antingen genom att man begränsar vilka som får
    delta, gärna med nån slags rss på nått sätt, jag tycker det är praktiskt;)\n\nEtt
    alternativ skulle kunna vara startandet av den ovan nämnda wikin, samt att du
    lägger in ett gäng människor med bra kommentarer som får vara med och blogga,
    det tror jag skulle kunna bli bra.

  comment_content: Emil, I'm one of those who subscribes to your blog feed.\n\nIn
    thinking about what you're talking about creating I can't help but think, "wow,
    that'd be difficult to pull off and be successful". I think you open your site
    up to more issues by allowing readers to post more than comments.\n\nI could see
    something more along the lines of a network of blogs much like 9rules that your
    readers could be part of. From that network make a website that pulls all those
    network member's feeds for one stop consumption.\n\nPersonally I appreciate your
    blog as a blog and probably wouldn't subscribe if just anybody could post articles.
    I'd prefer the idea of a network of blogs. \n\nMy 2 cents.

  comment_content: 'Short comment: Quality is of course very, very important. I don''t
    plan to let anything end up in the feed, that would be suicide (unless everything
    is great... :). I also have some idea how to filter people''s posts so that only
    the most relevant stuff shows up to people. Network of blogs is an interesting
    idea...'

  comment_content: Well, a honest and huge task. Do you know Sysiphus? You're doing
    something similar. But nevertheless, someone has to do it.\n\nFor a small demonstration
    about why you should do this read <a href="http://www.decloak.com/Dev/CSSTables/CSS_Tables_01.aspx"

    sit down and fasten seat belt before doing so :)

  comment_content: I'm sure quite a lot of people will like the community idea. Myself
    personally don't usually (hardly ever) have the time to deal with a community
    scenario. People like myself are only concerned about using the internet as an
    information portal, what's the new thing happening? I've got a coding problem
    which I need to find an answer for, what new applications (e.g. Flex/AIR) are
    there that can make my company better at what we do? in many ways it's a very
    ethnocentric philosophy but it's all we have time for.

  comment_content: There are already a thousand web development "communities" (err,
    forums) at least one of which a developer is usually a member.\n\nI use blogs
    as a source of information. If I want to ask a question I'll head over to niche
    forum on that topic, but that's after scanning my favourite blogs for the solution.\n\nWhat's
    more, I read blogs for pleasure too (even when I'm not looking for a specific
    solution or topic).\n\nI tried 9rules briefly but found there to be too much noise.
    A personal blog with iontelligent writing (which this is) is the best resource
    you can have.

  comment_content: I like the idea of a community but I would prefer if it was implemented
    as an extension to the current site so that I could still enjoy your posts in
    the same way as I do now with the option of dipping into the community side of
    things.

  comment_content: Hi Emil, a community sounds like a good idea and I will be more
    than willing to help out with design, management, etc. if required. \n\nThere
    are many forums out there already, but your own one would probably get a lot of
    those 1000 subscribers to register. That way, we can interact more easily.\n\nI'm
    on my PC, most hours a day and almost all the time in the weekend, so giving a
    helping hand would be no problem, if that has any interest.\n\nMail me if you
    have questions or something.\n\nall the best, Anders (Danmark)

  comment_content: Emil, it is an interesting and bold idea you are proposing. Like
    you, I have wondered about ways to engage a passive readership. User feedback
    is a strong motivator to continue blogging, yet it is seems the majority are happy
    to read rather than contribute.\n\nIt sounds as if you are proposing a multi-author
    blog, with guest authors being sourced from your existing readership. Done right,
    I think it could really work. Having additional authors would almost certainly
    open you up to a broader audience. I'm thinking about Vitamin and Digital Web,
    two multi-author blogs I subscribe to.\n\nI look forward to hearing more about
    your plans.

  comment_content: I visit your blog the most for the articles about html and CSS,
    although I would like to know more about Javascript. As an amateur website developer
    I learn a lot from your articles.\n\nI'm a little bit afraid a community might
    have a too high level for amateur website builders like me to be fair. On the
    other hand it also might give interesting sharing.\n\nHowever I wish you a lot
    of succes with either a blog or community! But I hope you still have time to write
    articles, I really like them!

  comment_content: As already pointed out, there are several communities out there
    already. I'm not sure if one more is the right thing to put your energy in to.\n\nI
    see blogs as a way to turn internet in itself in to a big community-like thing,
    where there are no restraints on "your" part of the community. You can create
    a site completley in SVG if you like, it is all up to you.\n\nSo, a good way to
    connect blogs together is the road I would like to see this to travel to. Maybe
    have a friends blog about javascript tightly connected? Maybe a blog about database
    design?\n\nI think it is important to let the ones that only reads read, the pageviews
    are showing you that your articles are appreciated.

  comment_content: I've been a regular reader for about a year now, and I'd say I'm
    with Nick. While some blog communities work well (I'm thinking of Joystiq), many
    are inconsistent and fail to demonstrate a cohesiveness. I think coming up with
    a blog network is a more interesting idea.

  comment_content: Hi! Just stumbled in here by your open IE letter. I love these
    really good blogs about web standards and stuff, but myself I've had enough of
    communities. Well, maybe it'll work, if I DO NOT have to register! Or you make
    a supermegadupersimple registration process. :)

  comment_content: The reason I started reading here was that it's not a community.
    I'd rather it went on the same way, maybe with guest authors. That could enrich
    the site better, I think.

  comment_content: Maybe you could just somehow make comments more central to the
    blog somehow? Or make the comments more dicussion-like with threads, maybe even
    a rating system like on Slashdot?\nI don't think you should make the site extremely
    user-contributed. We do come here to read you and don't want to lose that voice.
    A community site like this may be very cool, but please do it on another site
    or a separate area of Friendly Bit.

  comment_content: IMHO (as a feed subscriber) I personally don't feel a need for
    another forum-type of site. I do agree with the above comments regarding your
    (otherwise excellent) site in moving the comments from the sidebar to a more central
    place though, as that would make them a whole lot easier to read, code snippets
    could be read properly etc.\n\nAs for comments, I think people should have to
    leave name/e-mail etc but that sites should allow comments. You could moderate
    them the first time they post and let them post directly after that, and just
    keeping an eye on the comments.\n\nI know that wouldn't solve your initial question
    when it comes to users starting topics etc, but as stated above, I personally
    don't feel a need for another forum type of site, I am signed up to too many of
    them already, and weirdly it is becoming trickier to actually get quality answers
    after a while.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is "if you start the best developer
    community ever, that removes the need for any other community, please do go ahead,
    otherwise it might be a waste of your energy."\n\nJust my £0.02 :)

  comment_content: He he! "..one of the 1000..." sounds like the 4400 or something.
    :-)\n\nEither way, I think it sounds interesting, and the first thing that sprang
    to my mind as well was something Wiki-like for certain posts/articles or perhaps
    sections of the site.\n\nIf it works out? No idea, it could go either way. And
    this sounds <em>so</em> lame, but whatever you choose, I'm glad as long as the
    result is you continuing to contribute to the web.

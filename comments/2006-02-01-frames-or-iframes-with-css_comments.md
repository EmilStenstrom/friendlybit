  comment_content: My problem (and you probably explained it- please excuse my ignorance)...but
    In the Html editor I put the code for the html and on the topstyle file I list
    the css content I can not see how they converge. I opened a pratice page on Geocities
    and have added both saved files in the file manager. but it does not come up as
    one page. to give me the green back ground with the the title that I have placed
    on it my pratice link as follows <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thugsnluv7"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/thugsnluv7</a> can u see what I have done
    wrong...I would really like to know how to improve my skills so that when I open
    my real web site things will flow more easily.Thanks for your time\nEzell

  comment_content: I like your article. However I encountered a problems with the
    frame columns sample:If a picture (in my case 640x480 of size) is embedded into
    the text and IE6 is reduced to a size where a horizontal scroll bar would be needed
    the complete right side vanishes.\nWhith all that nice specifications that are
    meant to replace the evil we used before we seam again to get stuck in what should
    work but doesn't.\nAnyway thanks for this and your other articles. They are very
    helpful.

  comment_content: '@Michael: I see the problem. IE has strange ideas of how overflow
    works and I think the problem is that it expands the column even though it shouldn''t.
    Since overflow: auto; is set it should instead display a scrollbar. \n\nIn your
    case I think your should just let that be. I have 1% users with 800x600 resultion
    on this site, does your bug affect many enough so that it warrants a hack?\n\n[<strong>Update</strong>:
    Setting a width on that columns stops it from happening, is that a solution in
    your case? (might make linelengths a little nicer too...]'

  comment_content: Hej! Letade efter svar på frågan om man verkligen kan använda css
    som frames och fann din sida.\n\nHar sett en del ha en sida med div-element vars
    placering styrs med css. I varje sådan lägger de sedan ett html-dokument. \n\nDet
    fungerar men verkar inte riktigt rätt. Vad är det som gäller?\n\nHälsningar //

  comment_content: '@Jonas Ahlberg: Hejsan. Tanken med artikeln till höger är att
    förklara precis det. \n\nMen låt mig ta det igen lite kort: du använder först
    CSS för att få frames-liknande beteende. Sedan använder du något server-side språk
    (PHP, ASP eller liknande) för att lägga in t.ex. navigationen på alla sidor.'

    this page is not cross compatible.  The scrolling paragraph does not work in IE6.

  comment_content: '@Emil Stenström\nyour post 04 in reply to 03\nThanks for your
    suggestion. However it doesn''t really solve the topic. As on larger window size
    the scrollbar is not on the right any more and the content still vanishes when
    the window width is smaller than width of navigation + width of content.\nThe
    image size was just a sample. \nIf you assume an image of 1280x1024 the percentage
    of visitors where this fits on the screen would be lower.\nHowever I have no concrete
    problem. I just discovered this effect when I was playing around with your (great!)
    samples.\nMy comments may have been capable of being misunderstood as I think
    that CSS is a step in the right direction and using it has many advantages compared
    to coding the layout directly in HTML.\nThe problem that persists is that (browser)
    developers interpret and implement the specifications differently, forcing us
    to use workarounds or browser specific techniques.\nYour site is a great help
    to achieve this. I was just moaning about the imperfect world...'

  comment_content: Hello Emil,\n\nExcuse my ignorance here, I stumbled upon your site
    looking for some CSS help. I'm trying to use a 1024X768 jpeg as a background for
    my site. Simple but I would like to fix the size so the browser reflects the size
    of the background. I'm trying to prevent tiling when it's too small and underscan
    when the image is too big like it is now at 1024X768. I'm looking at it on a 14
    inch iBook. Hope this makes sense.\n\nThanks for any help.

    not sure if that will work in your case, what will you do if the content overflows
    that area? how will you handle people will a smaller resolution? Designing for
    the web is quite different from print design.'

  comment_content: Thank you Emil. This is just brilliant.\nI have spent some hours
    finding much more difficult and useless solutions to the "position:fixed;" problem
    in IE. Yours is simple, elegant... and works!! I have to test it in some more
    browsers but it looks great.\nAnd easy to understand for an spaniard like me ;-)

  comment_content: Hi. I really like this solution, but I just thought I'd let you
    know that none of the examples even appear in IE Mac! Maybe you don't worry about
    these users, and I'm not an IE Mac user (just use it for testing) but I do know
    people that still browse with it!

  comment_content: The article about using css to replace frames was extremely useful.
    I modified the two parts so that I have a header at the top and a navigation on
    the left which are fixed, whilst the content scrolls. The only problem I have
    found is the content of the paragraph "makescroll". It can include pictures, tables
    etc but if a "center" instruction or H1 H2 etc is used, the layout goes haywire.
    Very helpful article - thanks.

  comment_content: I have studied some of your information here, and I always learn
    something each time.  Thank you for this site.\n\nI am attempting to get away
    from using frames.  I have only one page using frames with selection buttons on
    the left selecting what is placed in the right frame.\n\nI read your post above
    about using PHP, and will have to study that some to see if I can make it work.\n\nMy
    PHP knowledge is limited, but in your post, I did not see a closing ?&gt; and
    wonder if it is required?  Currently, all I am doing with PHP is making sure any
    changes to my menu is applied to every page, and every page uses the same footer.\n\nAgain
    thanks for the PHP code that I am now off to study.\n\nBill

  comment_content: I used to use notepad++ but once I tried sublime I won't be going
    back. It is hands down the best. Super fast, tons of easy and awesome plugins
    (sublimeLinter!), it has increased my productivity tenfold.

  comment_content: Editors is definitely a touchy subject sometimes. But it's actually
    really a personal choice and your mileage can vary a lot.\n\nMy own list of requirements
    is very much alike yours. But I would add:\n\n- Extensibility. I want to be able
    to modify just about any aspect of it, so that I know it can change along with
    my changing requirements over the years.\n\n- Free software. I like the idea of
    open source a lot and will pick it over its proprietary counterpart any day of
    the week.\n\n- Terminal based. For me I've found the most efficient way to develop
    software is to skip the mouse completely. So I want to run my editor in a terminal,
    with tmux. As a plus, I am then pretty much platform independent.\n\nSo I am going
    with the "looks-like-shit-editors"; namely Vim. ;)

  comment_content: '@Tobias Sjösten: Well said! The three points you add are not at
    all important for me, but since Emacs and Vim are so popular you have lots of
    people agreeing with you :)'

  comment_content: Until recently i was using notepad++ i just found it nice and clean.
    Recently where i work just bought CS6 so i am using dreamweaver at work (as an
    IDE) its nice to be able to pull, push and get files from servers and view them
    quickly.\n\nAlthough sublime looks very nice.

  comment_content: I still love notepad++.  As they say - it's hard to teach an old
    dog new tricks!  Maybe some day i will try sublime text, since you recommend it!\nIf
    i can edit faster, maybe i can spend more time snowboarding!

  comment_content: I'm using Dreamweaver at the moment - mainly for the synergy with
    the other adobe software it has. I'm considering looking into Sublime Text 2 over
    the Christmas break though.

  comment_content: A little hidden fact with Sublime Text as well as with other editors
    like Notepad++ is that you are able to download the app for free but highly encouraged
    to purchase or donate should you like the product, even more if you are using
    it professionally. Just like Wikipedia, it is of great value but it cannot sustained
    on free beer :-)

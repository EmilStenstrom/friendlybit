  comment_content: Hi Emil,\n\nI had tired this, but always through a non-wireless
    connection and was underwhelmed. Now I get how it's supposed to work! Thank you
    :~)\n\nI am glad to note however, that both the latest versions of IE &amp; FF
    ask before sharing your location info with Google Maps. Otherwise, although exciting
    in a "The Future Is Now" type of way, it's also scary in a "1984", "Big Brother
    is watching you" kind of way! :-S\n\nCheers,\nMal xo

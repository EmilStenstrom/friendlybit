  comment_content: I would agree. It does spread some misconception. In many cases,
    someone just learning CSS may struggle to understand, and by adding divs all over
    the place simply re-creates the problem they had with tables. The structure is
    still lacking, the code bloat is still there, and there is no real understanding
    of css and positioning.\n\nUsing CSS would be much better than 'divs for layout'.

  comment_content: I can't do anything else than agree and can't see how someone could
    not do so.\n\nI also think that people should stop calling HTML a "programming
    language", but that's another topic...

  comment_content: I love how every says "beginners" when talking about tables for
    layout or divs for layout. It's not exclusive to beginners, but to those who have
    been in the industry from a time when tables <em>were</em> the way web sites were
    structured. \n\nThe web is still a new enough environment where even the most
    seasoned designer and developer is learning something new every day (or should
    be), and those who are experts are a grade or two above the rest, instead of drastic
    leaps and bounds. \n\nWhen it comes to web standards for structure and development,
    we're all still learning best practices. In 5 years, who's to say that CSS won't
    be passed up for something else that makes our markup cleaner, more precise, and
    faster to load?

  comment_content: '@jenn.suz.hoy: I say beginners in the sense "people that don''t
    know much about web standards". The same way I would call myself a beginner pizza
    maker, I don''t know anything about making a real pizza.'

  comment_content: A non-CSS styling system would need <em>decades</em> to get devised,
    designed, agreed upon and implemented into mainstream browsers. :)\n\n<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/">CSS3
    selectors</a> should go some way towards reducing the amount of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s
    and <code>class</code>es present in our markup. There's lots of other <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">CSS
    developments</a> which will make semantic HTML documents easier to style more
    efficiently, too.\n\nBut we'll need some <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and <code>class</code>es
    in there for several years, until CSS3 selectors gain mainstream support in the
    browsers most people are using. But there's so many structural elements that you
    don't need many even now.

  comment_content: divs are DIVIDERS to provide sections to our HTML markup. These
    sections group certain elements in that div which is the container for these elements.\n\nThough
    extra wrapper DIVS are used to make layouts work as intended.\n\n\n

  comment_content: Yeah, I always cringe when I hear somebody say that. \n\nI find
    that sometimes newly converted developers will actually code as though they are
    using tables, but they just use div tags instead of tr/td tags.\n\nEventually
    they'll get it.

  comment_content: Very good advice. I remember having a php textbook in a class,
    and it specifically taught you how to cut up tables to display your site properly.
    I've been looking for a better way to do that ever since, and CSS is clearly it.
    Thanks for helping me not make such a classic beginner mistake!

  comment_content: I've tried using DIVs for layouts and seem to have more problems
    with it than its worth.  Why are DIVs considered so much superior... especially
    when dealing with cms templates for example where dynamic content can really mess
    up alignment etc?

  comment_content: 'I agree with combining html with css as a powerful layout manner.
    But please: don´t combine just divs with css. You get much more effects if You
    remember the style option.I also agree in the meaning of &quot;There´s lots of
    elements out there&quot;. Although You noticed to open mind for the comunication,
    at Your own page You still prefer the using of div, instead using frames or tables.
    Is there any specific reason for Your code choice?'

  comment_content: Hmm, tricky call this one, as its a fine line. Whilst I remain
    neutral on the use of tables, I still believe that divs are the way forward.\n\nWhat
    MUST be educated to new CSS ers is that it is all to easy to fall into 'divitis'
    and this is what causes the problems. (divs within divs are almost as bad as nested
    tables).\n\nDO encourage the use of DIVs - DON'T fall into 'divitis'

  comment_content: '@fan-tiger\nI don''t agree with you on using the style function
    (I presume you mean using the HTML style attribute). It''s almost the same as
    using the font tag: you must edit multiple lines if you want to change something.\n\nI''d
    make a class instead and call it with the span tag.'

  comment_content: HTML is content driven! A DIV only page is rather drab from a code
    perspective, we all somewhat agree. Let's get more specific - with specificity!
    Thing with CSS and ALL the proprietary browser crapolla out there is they make
    it easy for beginners to cower into DIV-only design. Nothing works the way it
    should in a textbook. Make it dirt simple and simplify it until it eventually
    goes from flickering mouse-over to ... where'd that page go? Synchronize tables
    and lists, ladle factory resets into contemporaneous packages - and you've got
    a learning curve happening!

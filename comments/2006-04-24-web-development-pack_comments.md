  comment_content: This looks like a pretty complete list to me.  Firefox's Web Development
    toolbar is INDISPENSABLE.The only other tools I'd suggest are <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/"
    rel="nofollow">FileZilla</a> for FTP, <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net"
    rel="nofollow">Notepad++</a> for quick edits, and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/"
    rel="nofollow">7-Zip</a> for file compression (especially when web host control
    panels let you download your site as a g-zipped tar file).  All of these tools
    are excellent and free on SourceForge.net.

  comment_content: Great list. I'm gonna have to install OperaView and SearchStatus
    now..\n\nI'd also suggest <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/" rel="nofollow">Fiddler</a>,
    a HTTP debugging proxy, which regularly comes in handy &mdash; especially if you're
    coding a server-based web app, debugging UTF-8 problems, or doing any XMLHttpRequest
    stuff.

  comment_content: Having had the same problem I got myself a 1Gb USB memory stick
    where I installed portable versions of quite a few bits and bobs. This means I
    don't have to go and find all my Firefox extensions etc, my Thunderbird will have
    all settings for my mail regardless of computer, and my Filezilla (which now has
    replaced my FlashFXP) has all my server settings. I also have the IE standalone
    versions on it, as well as a full portable install of Eclipse development environment.
    Just synching it up with whatever computer I'm on (so I run it from the hd, not
    the stick) and I'm ready to go. :)

  comment_content: <a href="http://hapedit.free.fr/" title="HapEdit - Homepage Editor"
    rel="nofollow">HapEdit</a> is very good for writing directly in code and if you've
    got an local testserver up and running, which you should, it won't be too big
    of a hazzle to see what it looks like.\nIt's especially good for writing PHP or
    ASP as it allows you to compile and check the code "on the fly".

  comment_content: Useful list, especially the Firefox extensions. I can heartily
    recommend <a href="http://www.pspad.com/en/" rel="nofollow">PSPad</a> for HTML

  comment_content: I'd heartily recomment <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/"
    rel="nofollow">HTML-Kit</a> for a code editor. It works well for HTML, CSS, JS,
    PHP, ASP &amp; others, and is free for personal use.

  comment_content: Yeap... webdeveloper toolbar and IETab are great when designing
    cross-browser (or cross-platform) and i've heard that dreamweaver 8 actually renders
    and generates css content more accurately.\n\nGreets from México..

  comment_content: I would just change dreamweaver for nvu + crimson editor (to correct
    and have your syntax colored) fireworks for inkscape and flashfxp for filezilla
    (notice a pattern here? this are all free).  I would also toss either xampp or
    easyphp or uniserver just to avoid having to install apache, php and mysql (they
    all include them and on the plus side, uniserver is portable, you do not install
    anything)...

  comment_content: Camino is a great Mac browser. It uses the Gecko rendering engine,
    and I think it's much faster and easier to use than the Mac version of Firefox.

  comment_content: Very useful site for a newbie to CSS. Thanks for your work!\n\nI
    want to learn to use one good, solid web authoring system initially and have found
    Nvu, an Open Source application.\n\nDo you have any opinions on it as a starting
    point (I'm not able to buy Dreamweaver just yet!)

  comment_content: '@Michael: I''ve never used Nvu, so I can''t tell you any opinions
    about it. I tend to use something simple when I can choose myself. There''s a
    opensource project called notepad++ that I currently like, it''s simple and has
    color-coding for most languages.'

  comment_content: Amazing bug. Even selecting the text is broken. (The selection
    is bound within the borders, and copying proves that its actually misjudging which
    characters to select). Hm, this suggests that there is somehow actual text that
    is slightly smaller that the browser is aware of but not displaying, perhaps choosing
    to display a larger, smoother font?

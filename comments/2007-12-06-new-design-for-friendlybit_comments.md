  comment_content: Looking good, nice use of whitespace and much better top down order.\n\nThe
    color takes a bit to get used to for me, not that I have any sort of sense for
    it anyway.\n\nNo email required when commenting and no categories?\n\nShouldn't
    it say "I've" here?\n"I’m listened to your previous comments"

  comment_content: 'One word: \n\nPink? :)\n\nSeriously: \nWise to pick on IE6 and
    go for IE7. It is a difference than avoiding all versions of IE. Me likes. To
    give the comments more space is a good thing too, as it will be more attention
    to discussions and not just the articles.\n\nThumbs up.'

  comment_content: '@Trn: Great comments. I''d forgotten about e-mail, and I''ll think
    about categories, and if they are needed. Spelling corrected.\n\n@Anders Ytterström:
    Thanks!\n\n@Chris: The image is as far I''ve come design-wise. I have a static
    HTML file with all the content, so what I need to do is: 1) write the CSS, and
    2) convert the static files to a wordpress theme. I''m hoping for about two weeks,
    but we''ll see.'

  comment_content: Idéerna för den nya sidan tycker jag är jävligt skyssta, mes vad
    är grejjen med färgen? Det ser ut som att en påfågel har sprängts upp över hela
    ytan. Dessutom vet alla att vitt och blått är färgen alla sanna web 2.0-designers
    använder ;)\n\n\nNu till det jag skulle säga. De små blomklummelurerna som du
    har slängt upp på sidan är rätt trevliga, men skulle nog kunna bli ännu trevligare.
    Jag har några skyssta Illustrator penslar som har blomformer. De var gratis och
    open soucre och sånt, men jag minns inte var jag hittade dem. Säg till ifall du
    vill att jag ska maila dem till dig.

  comment_content: Emil, please don't take this the wrong way, but how is anyone supposed
    to be able to read anything with the lack of proper contrast between the text
    and the background?  And why are you ditching IE 6 and hacking for IE 7 in the
    first place?  From what I've seen there's no need to hack for one and ignore the
    other, unless you're really worried about PNG support or :hover on elements other
    than anchors - in which I'd look into using .hta or .htc files instead (served
    via a conditioanl comment specifically written for IE 5/6 if necessary).\n\nI
    also have to object to this:\n<blockquote>It seems to be hip inside the Googleplex
    to kick on people making money from other things than AdSense.</blockquote>\n\nThat's
    actually not the case.  Yes, Google said they would go after those who sold links,
    but it's not because they're trying to dominate the advertising market with AdSense.  It's
    because people were trying to abuse the PageRank system (as foolhardy as that
    is), nothing more.  If you're going to keep the ads (and this goes for the rest
    of you as well), just add rel="nofollow" to the links if the advertiser will let
    you.  Problem solved.\n\nThis also struck quite a nerve with me as well:\n\n<blockquote>I
    won’t make it work in IE6 (on purpose). This is for my own satisfaction, and seriously,
    any decent web developer should already have something better. Stats say 60% Firefox,
    16% IE7, and 14% IE6. Please upgrade people. I will test it in the latest version
    of Opera (4.2%) and Safari (4.5%). Why? Because I want more users with good browsers,
    and fewer with bad. And since this is a personal blog, I can choose. Yay!</blockquote>\n\nNow,
    you said this is your personal site, and as such I will respect that as well as
    your decision, but the "any decent Web developer" part really set me off.  Which
    is never a good idea.  Any decent Web developer will code to the standards and
    against the four major rendering engines that are available, not to a particular
    browser or browser version (yes, this includes the Web developer's favorite toy,
    Firefox).  For those who need a reminder (or simply don't know), the four major
    rendering engines are Trident (IE), Gecko (Camino, Firefox, Flock, Galeon, K-Meleon,
    Netscape, etc...), Presto (Opera), and WebKit/KHTML (Safari, OmniWeb - IIRC -
    and Konqueror respectively).\n\nNow, as for the design itself (deep breath, Dan),
    it appears too amateurish for me.  The purple just screams "mysticism and occult"
    to me for some reason (probably the shades you're using, as well as that pink
    in there as well), the text as I said before is hard to read due to the lack of
    proper contrast between the copy and the background, and also feels a bit hypnotizing
    as well.\n\nI've also noticed that your site reminds me a bit of Veerle Pieters
    and Molly Holschzlag's Web sites as well, especially with the aspects of those
    sites being incorporated in your design (probably unintentionally).  I actually
    like that, since it helps me (as someone who's a regular reader of molly.com for
    instance) to associate your site with the pillars of the community, and helps
    recognize right away (before reading one line of text) what the site is going
    to be about.  Kind of like how ProBlogger.net's design is quickly becoming the
    "standard bearer" of professional blog designs (at least in my opinion anyway).\n\nI
    do like the separation of comments from trackbacks, but would it be possible to
    use JavaScript to create a tab switcher that can display and "hide" the two depending
    on which is selected so that people who want to see who's linking don't have to
    scroll down to do so (especially for when there are a lot of comments on a particular
    blog entry, or a long comment, such as this one)?\n\n(Another thing I would include
    is a "subscribe to comments" feature - I don't read a lot of blogs, but of those
    I do, I prefer to follow the comments via email.)\n\nAnyway, I have other opinions
    (that go along with "scrap this and start over"), but I'll leave them for later
    if you like.

  comment_content: Really interesting and looking quite good, Emil.\n\nHowever, I
    can't really stick with the idea of not making a pre ie7 compatible layout. We're
    speaking so much of accessibility and what must be done, yet we still decide to
    make our websites inaccessible for pre ie7 users. Not very good, if you ask me..

  comment_content: '@Dan Schulz: Thanks for your comments, really helpful. \n\n1)
    About color: I''ve slightly tweaked (i was rather close already) the colors to
    adhere to the standards when it comes to <a href="http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html"
    rel="nofollow">contrast and brightness</a>. I believe it''s easy to read.\n\n2)
    I''m coding to the standards. But in this instance I won''t do extra coding to
    fix IE6, not with PNGs or otherwise. In my experience, and I''ve done quite a
    few difficult layouts, fixing IE6 bugs takes about half the total time. Not worth
    it.\n\n3) I''m saying that any decent web developer show use a modern browser
    as their default browser. I''m not saying that everyone should stop supporting
    IE6, big difference.\n\n4) I''ll think about the tab switcher, interesting idea.\n\n5)
    I''m sorry you don''t like it, but then again, to read the site via RSS you don''t
    have to see it. It''s really not an easy thing to like, since it''s rather colorish
    and different. Yes, it''s amateurish, I''m a design amateur.'

  comment_content: 'Hi Emil,\n\nJust a couple quick things before I head off to bed
    (been busy working on a custom WordPress theme all night)\n\n1.) Cool.  I''ll
    check it out in the morning (eh, afternoon, actually).\n\n2.) The only "fixes"
    I usually use are a .htc file for :hover, :focus and :active in IE 5/6, and adding
    the occasional height: 1% or overflow: hidden; property/declaration pair to a
    style rule (no hacking needed).  I hate transparent PNGs with a passion, but if
    I had to use them, <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/09/18/png8-the-clear-winner/"
    rel="nofollow">there is a way to get IE 6 "in line" without having to use a hack</a>
    (link: sitepoint.com).\n\n3.) I use Opera myself, and I''ve tried a LOT of them.\n\n4.)
    (slightly off-topic) I have a custom WordPress theme framework under construction
    that I''m hoping will save me a lot of time developing WordPress themes; the tab
    switcher is just one of the things that''ll be going into it.  Of course anything
    that makes it easier on the designer/developer and the user is a win-win scenario
    in my book.\n\n5.) I use the My Yahoo! service, so I only see the excerpts anyway.  So
    I have to head here anyway if I want to continue reading.'

  comment_content: Great with a new design. I agree with you that making a design
    work in IE6 isn't necessary, as long as the content is available anyway.\nIt might
    be a good idea telling IE &lt;=6 users that they should upgrade, so you get the
    message out - there isn't much point in IE6 users not liking the design.

  comment_content: '@Dan Schulz: Where to put those height: 1%, display: inline, narrowed
    widths, position: relative, overflow: hidden, or whatever IE6 decides is the bug
    of the day, is what takes the time. It''s just not worth my time. I''m well aware
    how much work it is, and in this instance I don''t feel it''s worth it. Thanks
    for the links.\n\n@Dan Pettersson: Good idea, added an ugly conditional comment
    to take care of that.'

  comment_content: Emil, when I have no choice but to use the declarations you mentioned,
    I usually just in-line them with the rest of the style rule since 99.995% of the
    time they don't conflict with other browsers or browser versions (exceptions being
    support for PNG alpha transparency, :hover on non-anchor elements, and cases where
    mixing height and min-height in the same style rule can cause a conflict of interest).\n\nThe
    rest of the time I just code around it.

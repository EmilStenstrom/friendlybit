  comment_content: Nice one. But the downside is that it only works for one click.

    if you click something else between it''ll work. <a href="#respond" rel="nofollow">Try</a>

    a fade without a GIF would be nice...'

  comment_content: Always good with alternatives. However, I'd argue that IE users
    are the users who would have the most use of/need for visual (and any other sort
    of) guidance... :-)

  comment_content: Hey, im not sure how useful that actually is. I mean yeah it works(the
    first time) but what happens when you wanna make your text longer? You could do
    this really painlessly with about 2 lines of <a href="http://www.jquery.com" rel="nofollow">jquery</a>.

  comment_content: '@Robert Nyman: Well, the IE users are getting fewer and fewer,
    and IE8 is approaching. Soon helping people will be easy :)\n\n@THE|ODIN: What
    do you mean "make text longer"?'

  comment_content: Hi,\n\nNice stuff, simply explained but I have to agree with Odin
    above there ... couple of lines of jquery and you're done.\n\nCheers.

  comment_content: Well, guys, it's useful in terms of progressive enhancement, where
    you should always do every enhancement at the lowest level, where it places the
    least burden on the end user's resources.\n\nUsing Emil's CSS method, the desired
    effect is achieved even without javascript -- to be enjoyed equally by those who
    don't have it enabled for some reason.\n\nI like it. So ... Thank you, Emil!

  comment_content: '@Jeff Seager: Thanks for your support :) There are pros and cons
    to both techniques. The descibed method is best when you believe that a yellow
    highlight is design, then it should be in the CSS. If you think it''s behaviour,
    then in the JS file.'

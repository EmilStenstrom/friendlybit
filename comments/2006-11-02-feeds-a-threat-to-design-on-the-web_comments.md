  comment_content: 'What should we do?\n\nI mean, I''m a heavy feed subscriber myself.
    Now it''s just so that I read the content and notice the design only when there
    are partial feeds or when I visit a site to get additional content (except news)
    or when I visit a site the first time.\n\nI used Thunderbird a year ago to subscribe
    to feeds and TechCrunch was presented in the page''s design. You know, it was
    like visiting the blog post from within Thunderbird. I don''t know whether that
    was Thunderbird following the source link or the feed itself that made it possible,
    but suddenly this stopped. Then, feeds looked just plain ugly, Times New Roman
    and the like. I switched to Google Reader since I wanted a web mail solution as
    well and here I am: missing the "real page" preview or how you call it but not
    knowing how to achieve this. Writing my own feed reader application that visits
    the site itself to show me the content the way it''s meant to be?\nI just like
    to subscribe to feeds to be notified whether something interesting and new is
    happening. I don''t mind visiting the site, but if Google Reader displays everything
    just fine, hell, why not?\n\nProbably this "post view" idea isn''t that bad at
    all. And writing a feed reader shouldn''t be too hard, should it?'

  comment_content: Content is king. Seriously.\n\nI think design, interactivity and
    so on are second to that. Of course there are web sites where design is more important
    than others; for instance, I find it highly unlikely that we will see rock band
    web sites as feeds in the near future. But then again, they might offer the latest
    news as a feed, but the rest of information on the web site.\n\nI'm more of the
    opinion that feeds and design can co-exist; frequently updated parts can be in
    feeds, but the complete information can be in the web page. Text for those who
    want it, and design for those who prefer that.\n\nBetter to cater to all than
    to choose just one of the paths. Hell, let's even call it accessibility!\n\nDon't
    let feeds and design compete; let them live in symbiosis instead! :-)

  comment_content: I'm with you. Unstyled web is too dull. Design speaks a thousand
    words.\nPartial feed and long live design.

  comment_content: '[...] Over at friendlybit, Emil talks of feed readers being a
    threat to a design on web. I find it a good article and something to think about.
    I&#8217;ve seen many debates over &#8220;Full vs Partial Feed&#8221; publishing.
    I&#8217;ve seen lots of talk on &#8220;Great Content vs Great Design&#8221;. Now
    Emil brought up another thought on &#8220;Users should decide vs Webmasters should
    decide&#8221; and &#8220;styling vs unstyling&#8221; web trends. The widely accepted
    rule was to let the users decide the layout; after all why should we need to download
    the same design over and over? Design was something the user decided, not the
    author. [...]'

  comment_content: I like feeds, and like them separate, simply because I want that
    choice to view it plain, or styled.  Some sites I like to read, don't have much
    going on for them in a design respect ,so I would think they would note it in
    their feed if they put any effort in the design.\n\nI typically go to the sites
    to read the articles, though, even if the full article is offered in my feed.  I'll
    scan my feeds, and open up what I want to read in a bunch of tabs.  It's a little
    taxing on my machine at times if I go overboard. I'll start closing tabs to read
    the next article.  I think everybody probably has their own habits with feeds,
    also.\n\nTo each their own.

  comment_content: I hate the whole idea of feeds for content. To me Live Bookmarks
    are it. If I want to read the content, I just go to the website, whats's the point
    of the feed?

    quite happily.

  comment_content: '@Christian Tietze, Rowan Lewis: That''s how I use feeds too: as
    a way to see when someone updated their sites. I use Thunderbird, and like Christian
    says I have about half of the sites showing like I want them,  fully rendered
    sites. \n\n@Robert Nyman, Roger Johansson: Of course content is king. This is
    about content with design and content without design.\n\nIf more and more people
    switch to feeds for accessing sites, then why should I care to maintain the design?
    So yes, they can coexist, but sooner or later one of them will take over.\n\nSomething
    else: Well marked up sites can easily get unstyled if that''s what you''re after,
    just disable the CSS. The "finding updated sites" part of feeds are damn useful,
    I''m not sure about the other parts.'

  comment_content: Emil,\n\nHow would one of them take over? A web site is almost
    always a hierarchical representation. You have news, about, contact, information
    pages etc.\n\nThe only one of those that could be turned into a useful feed is
    news, the other onea need to be "real" web pages.

  comment_content: '@Robert Nyman: So lets take it to the news page then. Why bother
    designing it if most people access it by feed?\n\nI''m sure you could push the
    other pages into feeds. We push most content into the "scientific paper" model
    HTML gives us today.'

  comment_content: I think that unstyled feeds and designed sites can definitely co-exist.  Perhaps
    it's me wishfully thinking, but personally when I'm sifting through my feed reader,
    I definitely take time out to open articles in my browser just so I can read the
    author's writing in the intended environment.  I might be the only one who does
    that, however.\n\nI can definitely understand your concern about one beating out
    the other, but in the end I think it comes down to reader preference.\n\nI can
    infer that a significant amount of my readers use RSS only to read my articles,
    so asking "Why bother designing anything" can come up. How I respond to that is
    that there are still going to be first time readers stumbling across the site
    every day.  There are going to be new readers finding an article after searching
    Google for something they want to learn about.  Your design will still be seen
    by many.

  comment_content: 'I use a feed reader (Sage for Firefox) to quickly scan my favourite
    blogs for new posts, but I very seldom will read a full article within the reader.\n\nIt''s
    about getting the best of both worlds. Unstyled (or uniformly styled) feeds allow
    me to quickly ascertain the "interestingness" of content, but when I view the
    article in its original context I can enjoy the benefits that a website offers:
    images, elegant text styling, javascripty goodness, comments, and just plain sexiness.'

  comment_content: The idea that feeds are a threat to design on the web is a little
    bit alarmist. XML feeds (such as those in RSS format) allow true separation of
    content and design.\n\nTake a look at the specs for XSLT and see how an XML feed
    can be styled using a basic transformation language and CSS. The ultimate result
    is similarly formatted content becomes easier to style for designers.

  comment_content: When you are using the internet for learning and documenting so
    the content is all that matter. Unstyled feeds allow you to look beyond the "wrapper"(the
    nice look) of a "product" (the article).\nI disagree that they will stop coexisting.
    People tend to visit 5-10 sites all the time (not web developers).. they will
    use feeds as "reminders" and visit the real site .. where style takes the crown.

  comment_content: I have had an issue with Google Docs and I have successfully contacted
    Google on several occasions and all I can say is that Google staff are extremely
    polite, helpful and professional.  I cannot fault them on their service whether
    it be via a post or via email!

  comment_content: '@Jason: Good to know that the Google Docs people are easy to get
    in contact with. Could it have something to do with that they have paid (enterprise)
    versions of Docs?'

  comment_content: Google is here in the Netherlands very helpful and most of the
    time they respond within 24-48 hours (on workdays).\n\nSure most of the question
    were about paid services, but Emil do you think thy should provide lots of personal
    support for free services?\nI like to see Google developing great products instead
    of spending a lot of hours for support. ;)\n\n(You're right feedburner s___ks
    since google own this service)

  comment_content: '@Olaf: To me, it''s more important that old services keep working,
    than releasing lots of new products. But that''s my own preference.'

  comment_content: YES, I've found it very hard to get support, and pretty much impossible
    to report bugs with google software.\n\nI guess they have some google groups?
    A lot of the time I can't even find group though, and when I do, I tend to find
    the I don't get a response in a reasonable time frame.\n\nI think by setting up
    those groups they are basically trying to get users to provide support for each
    other, which is kind of stupid, since their software has actual bugs in it that
    other users can't fix.\n\nWhich brings me to the other issue I've found is that
    a lot of google software is just plain buggy. Google docs is the worst offender
    here. Every single time I have used google docs, on various browsers, including
    chrome, I have run into some show stopping bug, like their editor crashing while
    I'm editing a document, or it just fails to start altogether. Docs seemed like
    a good idea, but I can't use something so unreliable...\n\nI use a lot of google
    services, and some are great, but some of their software just plain *doesn't work*
    and should never have been released. For instance, I tried subscribed links when
    it was released, and it was just plain broken.

  comment_content: Good observations, Emil. This is my biggest complaint about Microsoft,
    too. I think it is important to keep existing services working well, and not so
    important to develop more and more and more.\n\nI am weary of the endless outlandish
    claims of some new and better product that is going to save the world, or change
    the world, or rock the world. Give me something that works, and make it work really
    well, and make it simpler and leaner all the time, and you will keep me as a customer
    forever.\n\nMore is almost never better. Too many features, too many controls,
    make things difficult for no reason. It's too bad most developers fail to understand
    that.

  comment_content: I've never tried to contact Google’s support.  I just took it if
    something wasn't working right, they would just slap a "Beta" sticker on it so
    you couldn't complain.

  comment_content: I didn't know that Google had support for anything. I know there
    are forums for help, because I used one when putting a Google map on my website.

  comment_content: Thanks for your post, I was not seeing HTML5 this way. The thing
    is that we don't have all the information in the same place, you need to find
    the news by yourself all over the internet ... what a work !

  comment_content: Just because the "HTML5 parser" can parse HTML4 don't make HTML4
    equal to HTML5 as HTML5 is different.\n\nTherefor if I choose to make HTML4/XHTML.
    I choose to not use the new features of HTML5 that is not implemented in all browsers
    yet. \n\nAnd there will be no problem to make pages with HTML4 or XHTML because
    as you say "HTML5 is made to be backwards compatible". So it's possible to continue
    using HTML4!\n\nAll browser will not switch to "HTML5 parser". A lot of them will.\n\nWe
    choose what browsers we use, and we choose what standard we follow. \n\nAnd you
    don't seems to understand the recommendations vs browsers connection.

  comment_content: We can't use <em>real</em> HTML4 because no real-world browser
    parses it as SGML application, with reading DTD and all SGML features like "null-end
    tags". The parser that browsers actually use is much more like HTML5 parser then
    SGML parser (which is used by W3C HTML validator), because HTML5 parsing algorithm
    has been designed after the real browsers parsing reverse engineering. So writing
    HTML4 we are getting in fact something like "HTML4.5" :)\n\nXHTML is the different
    case because it's XML and XML parsing rules are the same for all supporting browsers.
    AFAIK, HTML5 spec has been designed so that any XHTML1.x page served with appropriate
    media type can be considered also as "XHTML5" page (although with obsoleted doctype).

  comment_content: It is true that HTML 5 is coming in full force.  But I don't see
    things changing anytime soon.  There are still many people using browsers that
    don't support HTML 5.  And it still hasn't gone mainstream.  But I definitely
    do want it to come as fast as possible because there are a lot of great features
    about it.

  comment_content: I did not realize how quickly html5 was moving into the market.
    It is an exciting technology. But the standard is still not complete which means
    that fragmentation will be an issue. But with the functionality it will create
    can only mean good things.

  comment_content: Since html 5 is backward compatible, html 4 can still be used,
    simply by not using the new html 5 features, only the parser will be different
    the rest remains the same, more or less. But with the features it has HTML 5 will
    soon take over.

  comment_content: Guys, checkout html5boilerplate.com - HTML5 is production ready.
    Except for some features, but the basic stuff works in all browsers, even down
    to IE6.

  comment_content: I'm pretty glad to be fair :) \n\nThe only current downside I can
    see using HTML5 is JavaScript support. Many fallback solutions use JavaScript
    to create the various new HTML5 elements, when JavaScript is turned off on say
    IE7, your HTML5 design fails unfotrunately. However, like everything on the web
    you need to note your audience. IF you're developing a council website whose users
    all use IE6 (local councils are notorious for not upgrading, ever :) ) then HTML5
    really isn't an option currently. However, if you're designing a site aimined
    at web designers, who are more likely to be using the latest browsers then HTML5
    is essential. \n\nJavaScript support is the only reason that slightly puts me
    off using HTML5 for everything.

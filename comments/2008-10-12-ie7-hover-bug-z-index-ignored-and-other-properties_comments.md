  comment_content: Have you tried IE8?  If so, does the same bug exist there?  If
    so, have you reported it?

  comment_content: '@Someone: No, I haven''t tried IE8. Last time I tried it out it
    was so broken it couldn''t even render the simplest of things. I''m hearing it''s
    gotten better, but I think I''ll wait another beta version.'

  comment_content: You could always give IETester a try. It provides a clever way
    of running multiple IE versions side by side, and it includes beta version 2 (i
    think) of IE8.

  comment_content: Do you really think not supporting IE6 is acceptable these days,
    even if its just for an intranet (or even if its NOT an intranet)?

  comment_content: '@Pin W: Yes. In this case, I''ve carefully looked at the browser
    stats for this intranet. We''re 90 people, all using something newer than IE6,
    so I don''t see a reason to go through the annoyance that is fixing-for-IE6. Don''t
    you agree?'

  comment_content: Imagine what we could do if IE was not here anymore? This article
    brought a smile to my eyes:\n\n<a href="http://digg.com/software/Mozilla_IExplorer_biggest_problem_in_advancing_the_Web\n\n"Mozilla:"

    IExplorer biggest problem in advancing the Web. \nnews.cnet.com — IE still doesn't
    remotely approach Firefox, but we do hope to see IE standards compliance and its
    modern features improved. The single biggest problem now in moving the Web forward
    is having to deal with people using back versions of IE."

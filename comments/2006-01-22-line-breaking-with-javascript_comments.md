  comment_content: 'Transitional is used more: maybe just to use depreciated HTML
    in strict?\n\nThese sort of sites are not made by webdesign pros that use standards
    but seems more developers that know some CSS and other.\n\nOr maybe the templates
    are faulty?'

  comment_content: '@Velaluka: I think you can blame templates in some cases. I know
    a lot of developers that I would like to give this tutorial to though.\n\nBeing
    valid Transitional is surely better than not being valid at all, it''s just that
    there''s no reason to use that doctype. As I say in my <a href="http://friendlybit.com/css/cross-browser-strategies-for-css/"
    rel="nofollow">cross browser tutorial</a> transitional can get you in troubles...'

  comment_content: '@Todd Currie: I skipped going over all the details in the last
    step. Here''s a short explaination of the four lines you pasted:\n\n1) <strong>font</strong>
    Sets font-size to 80% of the users default and a line-height of 1.4em (I could
    have used 140% too, don''t know why I didn''t). Also sets the font-family to Arial.\n\n2,
    3) <strong>margin</strong> margin takes one, two, three or four values. I''ll
    write a short article about this in the future, stay tuned!\n\n4) <strong>list-style</strong>
    removes the bullets on a list which makes them look better.'

  comment_content: '@Jordan Stewart: Good question. The reason is that screen readers
    are known to hide things with display: none, something that defeats the purpose
    of adding it in the first place. It''s a bit annoying but at least the workaround
    is not that hard.\n\nVisibility: hidden; would not remove the element, it would
    still take up space.'

  comment_content: When you chose not to display the legend and text for the search
    button, it appears you just used indent to push it off the left of the screen.  Why
    did you do this instead of doing a {display:none}?\n\nGreat site it's been really
    informative!

  comment_content: The only problem I have with the layout is that when you drag the
    window size, the advertisement, nav bar, and the "4,379 people online part" move
    all over the place. How can one fix this?

  comment_content: it looks good, but if you make the text larger (eg if you have
    bad eyesight) it overflows its boxes.  Is this is fundamental problem with the
    method/css?

    to 200px. Change it to 10em instead and it should work better when zoomed. Thanks

  comment_content: Nice site, very nice tutorial.  Only bug I can see in this whole
    thing is that it's really unnecessary for theses sites to do almost any onsite
    optimization.  The degree of offline optimization these guys do is remarkable.  Check
    them out in backlinks, you will be surprised at how many people link to them.

  comment_content: While I don't like flash, I think I know one of the main reasons
    for doing so:\n\nThere is no "view source" in flash.\n\nMany major companies still
    thinks that the user being able to see how something was achieved is somehow a
    big problem ...

  comment_content: I agree with a lot that you have to say here, but that one point
    you have in your showdown for "graphics" is a little misleading.  The potential
    for tightly integrated sound, video, and animation is what is driving a lot of
    these Flash sites.  For many customers, Flash's superior capacity for an interactive
    experience dwarfs all the other concerns, though they are legitimate.  \n\nAlso,
    the "hipness" rating of poor is pretty subjective.  A lot of the ideas about what
    is hip just comes from the community you associate with. \n\nLastly, your "Ease
    of content change" bit about Flash is definitely worst case.  If you build a Flash
    site that needs dynamic content, you're going to build a CMS as you'd mentioned
    above, you're not going to make your customers use the Flash IDE(which runs on
    OSX as well as Windows).  \n\nI do agree with the majority of what you said though!  There
    are certainly plenty of sites running around now or in the works that are full
    Flash just for Flash's sake, and could be implemented with better with AJAX.

  comment_content: I think your table is a bit off. Sure, Flash can be poor at Accessibility
    but only if you have a bad developer. And the ease of content change is totally
    off base.

  comment_content: Thanks for the mentioning of ASK!\n\nWhen it comes to content updating,
    to my knowledge, it is always done by importing XML into the Flash move nowadays
    (at least for professional web sites and/or web sites that pretty much don't need
    to be updated since they're short-lived campaign sites).

  comment_content: '@Kaj: wooptoo''s comment is true here, it is possible to decompile
    a swf. I see your point though, people *think* that flash protects them and use
    flash because of that.\n\n@Don: Interactivity is probably one of the major points
    on why people choose it. I somehow incorporated it into "Graphic effects" in the
    chart. Whether the other points outweigh the interactivity one is up to the client,
    I think it does.\n\nThe hipness is very subjective, but I''d love to see some
    popular flash galleries if you have them. Is there a flash movement going on that
    matches the Web 2.0/AJAX thing that''s going on right now? In that case I''ve
    missed it.\n\nAbout the use of a Flash CMS: yes you do need them, and as you say,
    using the Flash IDE is out of question. The rating of Poor comes from the fact
    that building a CMS is a lot of work, so what most people do is use an existing
    one. Problem is that there''s very few CMS:es available for Flash...\n\nThanks
    for your comment!\n\n@Ryan Stewart: How do you make flash as accessible as a standards
    based website? Text-zoom? Screen readers? Plugin demand? Skip links? Semantic
    markup (headers, lists...)? Most sites even require javascript to include the
    needed files (and to avoid the "click to activate" problem in IE). That''s not
    accessibility to me.'

  comment_content: 'Hi, First im all for web standards.\nSecond, I couldnt disagree
    more with this post except Accessibility. And yes I''ve seen sites that shoudnt
    rely on Flash (content is king).\n\nUsability: Depends on the developer. Rezise
    etc.\nSEO: Dont know about the future but massive promotion via TV/advertisment
    is enought. Thank god flash isnt SEO friendly.\nEase of content change: Make your
    CMS deliver XML.\nHipness: Its in the eye of the beholder.\nGraphic effects: Flash
    is light years in front of Javascript. Vector etc.\nIntegration with existing
    sites: Spells XML and Javascript.\n\nUpdating flash files is hard: NO, for experince
    web agencys it the same patch/deploy routines as if you would develop sites with
    Javascript/HTML with backend capabilities.\n\nI think one should compare Flash
    with a magazine or TV (now, how accessible are they?). The differens is that Flash
    is Web 2.0 for TV/Video Game/Magazine.'

  comment_content: '@Robert, Pär: XML, you say, that means some kind of integration
    with existing tools, and limits the number of existing CMS:es available. If XML
    import is a common way that''s always used that makes a bit better on the CMS
    front. Thanks!\n\n@Pär: Usability: Of course it depends on the developer, a developer
    can always rewrite the system and make it usable, the question is if the default
    makes it easy or not. HTML makes things easy, flash has an entirely different
    focus.\n\nSEO: I don''t agree.\n\nHipness: You can''t have missed the Web 2.0
    boom, and flash is nowhere in it :)\n\nUpdating: See comment above, I''m not talking
    about deployment.\n\nNice to see someone of a different view commenting.'

  comment_content: Thanks for the well written piece. I mostly agree though another
    area for which Flash is superior is sound. We develop tools for kids with disabilities
    and music, speech, and sound effects are great tools that browsers do a lousy
    job of supporting. As the world moves to web deployed applications rather than
    simply sites, sound will become (I hope) more important and better addressed.

  comment_content: i'd just like to point out that i agree with the above commenters
    that flash can easily access XML files which can be outputted from CMSes just
    as easily as HTML.\n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that i like it (because i
    don't) but it's still an option.\n\nalso, i ran across this great article at thinkvitamin
    awhile back that had an example of a flash site that also had the content built
    into the page as DIVs that were hidden. this made the site easier to optimize
    for search engines and accessible.\n\n<a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/css/real-world-css-zen-for-your-site\n(see"

  comment_content: Emil, pls specify if this article is about web applications or
    web campains. The links you provided confuses me.\n\nNike, Coca-Cola and E-L are
    company sites that should have a solid backbone site using more or less static
    HTML. Yet use a campain as frontpage.\n\nDeparted, Underworld Evolution and Matrix
    are feature film sites which in my opinion is short lived sites and are dependent
    on hi-end graphics/animations and sound. \nLet IMDB archive any info of value
    about the movies.

  comment_content: 'Just to add: not only can you de-compile with various tools, but
    more importantly, you can compile and create .swf files with various tools that
    are not the Adobe Flash application.\nI know several ActionScript developers who
    don''t even have Flash (the IDE) installed because they don''t need it.\n\nAs
    for content updates I agree with the above comments: if it is hard to update the
    content of the site it is probably built incorrectly to start with.\nImages/text/xml/video/sound
    can all be pulled in dynamically, not to mention of course, other swf files.\n\nFlash
    does have another benefit: if you have the plugin it pretty much looks the same
    regardless of platform/browser etc. If you think this is insignificant try explaining
    advanced cross-browser and cross-platform debugging to a paying client. ;)\n\nThis
    all makes me sound like I''m a Flash fanatic. I''m not. In my work we just have
    to use the technologies that are best for the purpose of solving that particular
    business problem. Sometimes it is Ajax. Sometimes it is Flash.'

  comment_content: like other commenters have said, flash works well with xml.  so
    you can set things up where you can upload a text file in one folder and images
    and the other, and you have new content without touching the flash file itself.  flash
    not being 'dynamic' is a hugh misconception i think.\n\nfor rich media, flash
    is king, there's no comparison.\n\nand another thing, browser hacks are annoying.  with
    flash- you have to deal with plugins but aside from a few linux nerds(and thats
    changed now), who doesn't have flash installed that is savy enough to buy or look
    up things on the net?  and what it looks like on firefox/safari, it looks like
    on ie6.\n\ni don't understand the reference to the nike site.  i think it's a
    great site.  you can't do a site like that in all ajax. \n\ni wouldn't want yahoo
    or google to be all in flash.  but i am glad yahoo does use flash in some areas
    (like yahoo movies, tv, etc.).  and for brands like nike, mini cooper, etc. i
    rather see it in flash than complete web standards.

  comment_content: Hey, it's ok Emil, come out of the cave ;) The Flash community
    is bigger and more active than ever. The tools/compilers/IDEs are all free, no
    need to buy the Flash IDE unless you are a graphic designer). Not to mention the
    whole table in this post reads like it was written in 1999. I want to help you.
    Check out sites like OSFlash.org to see the latest open source community buzz,
    check out papervision3d.org for the most high tech Flash that the browser will
    not be able to offer in your lifetime - careful not to understate consumers, they
    are bored of HTML, they need more than a bit of hacky JS animating a few transparent
    PNGs to give the effect of rounded corners (after spending hours on that particular
    effort for little return), they want full screen HD video, live data, interactive
    charts, music, 3d and so on. Trust me, I've been there with JS for several years
    and it is a nightmare in comparison, instead of being excited about a new browser
    version, it's something to fear, once you taste a proper language that has great
    tools (like FDT for Eclipse and FlexBuilder) you will never want to turn back.
    There is a really important decision coming up for AJAX folk as their libraries
    are left behind by Flashers using things like Flex for RAD, Flash for incredible
    visuals and sound, Binary Sockets to communicate directly with the database or
    anything else you wish, live asynchronous updates of data using data binding (e.g.
    Flex Data Services), and accessibility is stronger than most AJAX sites by default
    (<a href="http://niquimerret.com)." rel="nofollow">http://niquimerret.com).</a>
    SEO is exactly the same for Flash sites as it is with AJAX sites, trust me on
    that one, anything that loads data asynchronously requires the same SEO solution
    using URL re-writing and agent sniffing, and as a matter of fact Google *does*
    read inside SWFs. Finally more people have Flash player than people who have JS
    turned on (that's a fact). If you need a helping hand getting started, there's
    a lot of people willing to help, so join in and get up to date, for the good of
    the web!

  comment_content: In answer as to why all these flash sites exist seemingly for no
    reason, its simply about a fuller experience through audio and visual presentation
    and user interaction. It's all very subjective whether you like the result or
    not, hence you'll always have these arguments about Flash V Ajax etc etc. IMOH
    its all about solving the problem and meeting the objectives using the correct
    technology for the right job. All these emerging technologies have a place and
    you'll find that they blend into each other. To me its all much of a muchnes.\n\nYour
    argument "Flash files are hard to update" because you need a special program is
    mildly amusing and hardly a reason as to why not to use it. As for it being hard
    to update, that really depends on how complicated it is to begin with. It can
    be as hard as coding in COBAL or editing a css file. \n\nAs for dynamic update
    of content, your argument is totally flawed. As a flash developer working with
    our technology team we haven't had any problems integrating flash into the CMS's
    of various clients. The flash just loads in a snipet of xml, or we consume a webservice
    or ultimately have information passed in through the object/embed tags. It isn't
    rocket science and certainly not a strong argument for using Ajax.\n\nAs for Flash
    not being hip, again very much in the eye of the beholder.\n\nI love Flickr (ajax
    site) and wouldn't want it made in flash, at the same time i like www.nike.com
    and of course www.coca-cola.com

  comment_content: Flash 9, or Flex, has many good uses. I wouldn't put Flex on consumer
    sites unless there was a specific app that benefited from the functionality. But
    for a lot of applications Flex is superb. You can also make it a standalone desktop
    application. \n\nAJAX, for all its present day de rigeur glory, isn't exactly
    a rosy thing to maintain either. For a simple 'behavior' I have to import an entire
    protocol.js, just because I don't know precisely where the functionality is coming
    from. The page size is big. And everything is useless if JS doesn't work. It's
    a lot more difficult to break the security glassbox of Flex. It's a cinch to do
    it with JS in the wrong hands.

  comment_content: Couldn't agree more with what you mentioned. The thing that bothers
    me most right now with these RIAs, is that they break the browser paradigm. Granted
    AJAX does it too to some extent, but you at least get to copy links, text etc.
    It takes a whole lot of extra effort to get these functionalities up and running
    on RIAs.

  comment_content: 'Admittedly I haven''t read every comment (obviously you touched
    a nerve!), so apologies if I repeat statements that have already been made.\n\nI
    worked many years as a full time Flash developer, and as has been mentioned, we
    would have our CMS output XML files, from which Flash would extract most of the
    site''s content. Also worth noting is Flash remoting - the ability to communicate
    directly with the server via PHP etc. \n\nMost Flash developers these days separate
    out a lot of their actionscript into external classes - plain text files that
    can be edited in any text editor. So it''s not strictly true that the Flash authoring
    tool is required to edit a Flash site.\n\nI agree with your observation that full
    flash sites usually exist to support a product launch. They are commonly about
    marketing, and have a short life span. I have observed that of all the sites I
    visit with any regularity, not one of them is a Flash site. And I am a flash developer!
    One exception to the rule would be image intensive sites - I''m thinking specifically
    of portfolio sites for photographers and graphic designers, which are commonly
    built in Flash.\n\nWith the accessibility thing: most Flash developers couldn''t
    care less. Seriously, they don''t care.\n\nWith SEO, I agree Flash is woeful.
    Flash developers have to bend over backwards to try and expose their site content
    to search engines using all sorts of cunning tricks. If your content is stored
    in external XML files, you can parse the XML server-side and present it as HTML
    to search engines (that''s what I do).'

  comment_content: Yes, my website is 100% flash designed.  But that's not why I am
    commenting. I am learning web standards.  I agree with all the articles that I
    have read about web standards.  After reading several articles on JavaScript,
    PHP, CSS,XML, XHTML ect... (I've read a lot in one day)I am not as intimidated
    by learning the right way to design web sites.  However, I feel that your article
    on "Flash vs AJAX was bias.  True there are some advantages of Ajax over Flash,
    especially, in the area of SEO and accessibility.  But Flash has advantages over
    AJAX as well.  Flash can deliver video without the problem of codex, a larger
    variety of text (regardless if the user has the text on their computer) can be
    used with flash, sound and a few more that I can't think of right now.  Your article
    didn't mention these things.  It was as if someone was bending your arm to mention
    that flash is better at graphic effects.  I say that because right after you gave
    flash props, you turned right around and made AJAX seem not as lacking by mentioning
    the advances of graphics through CSS.  It is your article and therefore you can
    make it seem all lop sided if you'd like, but as a flash user, i'd like to point
    out it is a better application than you give it credit. Flash still has a large
    following.

  comment_content: '@Demetrius McClain: Thanks for you comment. You''re of course
    right that the article is biased, and I could probably have mentioned video and
    sound more clearly if I wanted to promote flash. Now there''s Silverlight and
    JavaFX too, and why not the old and sturdy Java applets? The article is biased,
    but it''s biased because I don''t think flash/silverlight/javafx is the right
    future of the web. We need cross-browser/cross-OS systems that are open to everyone,
    and CSS/HTML/JS delivers just that.'

  comment_content: Javascript with DHTML is just as effective as Flash. Never understood
    why Flash has done so well.

  comment_content: 'Some good points, some not so good points.\n\ncomment #4 by Ryan
    could sum up this article. It all depends on the developer responsible for the
    application. \n\nIf you break it down, the root goals to any web application <em>should</em>
    be accessibility to all users. That being said, it brings us back to our dilemma,
    do you have the right developer for the job at hand. After all we are merely discussing
    an application, in this case Flash. The application is only as strong as the developer
    behind it. The same can be said for any other programs or languages.\n\nIn conclusion
    they both have strengths and weaknesses when put to the same test. Bottom line,
    a flash-only and an AJAX only site wont fair too well on a standard cell phone
    browser.'

  comment_content: 'No offense, but this article is biased towards Flash. Flash is
    great technology, it''s just often misused. I agree that for standard websites,
    Flash is a no-no; however, for rich internet applications, Flash and Flex beat
    JavaScript any day. There''s a reason web applications like Buzzword (<a href="http://www.buzzword.com/)"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzword.com/)</a> use Flash/Flex and not JavaScript:
    it''s just more effective for the job. All your negative comments toward Flash
    are basically nill when talking about RIAs.\n\nAccessibility: When was the last
    time you saw a blind guy editing a photo on Picnik?\n\nSEO: There isn''t really
    any content to search on a RIA.\n\nEase of content change: This isn''t an issue
    because there is no content. And I''d argue that making changes to an application
    are easier with Flex (Flash is a bit iffy).\n\nAlso, like some have said, Flash
    is clearly the only effective way to put video, sound, and other rich media on
    your website. So I believe you can''t compare Flash and Ajax, they are two completely
    different technologies that do two completely different things.'

  comment_content: '@Sasha: Thanks for your comment. I see what you mean with RIAs
    not containing any content, and I agree that some applications are like that.
    The thing is that people use Flash for all sorts of things, including publishing
    of content. That''s the kind of Flash use I''m against, not embedding sound or
    video somewhere. Agreed?'

  comment_content: Hard to believe this page was written at the beginning of last
    year (2007). As someone else says, it reads as though it was written seven or
    eight years earlier, not in an internet era permeated with swfObject and YouTube.
    The "accessibility" nonsense is particularly dated. Any "accessibility" feature
    you wish is perfectly achievable in a Flash module or a Flash-only site. You don't
    need to buy a program, and you don't need to design on a timeline to build in
    AS3. You don't even need to recode to update text and images. Finally, you'll
    never find a Flash developer trashing AJAX out of envy or ignorance. The technologies
    are not rivals.

    Sites using swfObject, or YouTube for that matter are not part of that group of

  comment_content: Ah, yes, a subtle distinction. Personally I regard a Flash site
    embedded in html and swfObject (or similar code) to be pure Flash nonetheless.
    It has to get into the browser somehow. If you seriously meant that you've seen
    a lot of sites that are nothing but SWFs, then that would indeed be extraordinary!

  comment_content: I agree with many things you have to say here, but there is a point
    that has in its confrontation of "graphics" is a bit misleading. The potential
    for a fully integrated audio, video and animation is what is driving many of these
    sites in Flash. For many customers, higher capacity Flash for an interactive experience
    dwarfs all other concerns, though they are legitimate.

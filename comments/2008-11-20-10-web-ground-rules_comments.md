  comment_content: Nice write-up. I've struggled to explain quite a few of these ground
    principles to some. In particular print/advertising agencies that mistake the
    web for just another channel for their work, which is saddens me because at the
    end of the day a lot of companies tend to listen more to them than us.. this article
    will help me make a stronger stance next time ;)

  comment_content: Hi Emil,\n\nThat was a very good write-up, I like the reference
    to the Cluetrain Manifesto !! We try to do most of what you wrote on our sites.\n\nI
    think any company that does not read and learn from your article will simply end
    up as roadkill !!\n\nPeter

  comment_content: <blockquote>Many newspaper make this mistake, and end up with users
    leaving their site for Google, trying to find more information about a particular
    piece of content.</blockquote>\nIn some cases, that's because they have an amateur
    template that doesn't allow people to include external links. My local newspaper
    website sometimes refers to other websites in the article body but even then it
    isn't a hyperlink, so you have to copy-n-paste it into the URL bar. Useless!

  comment_content: '@Stevie D: I''m sure that''s often the case. To include links
    should be top priority on any web project. Links <strong>are</strong> the base
    of the web, it''s time for people to start to realize this.'

  comment_content: Very good listing; I needed to read this to remind me of some of
    the fundamentals I find myself forgetting over time!

  comment_content: I'd say big companies make these mistakes more than anyone else.\n\nThere's
    so much information on the Internet now people want to read something worthwhile
    that has a personality and background to it.\n\nA page full of text that has no
    personality, nothing to show it is relevant to anything else (links) is dull and
    boring.

  comment_content: Great Article!  I like how you mention that people are scared to
    link in and out to other websites.  I've seen lots of websites that do this.  Websites
    like this could potentially hurt themselves. Also your comments on giving your
    content away for free and people will copy your content.  If you have great content
    people will want to use if and if you don't let them, they will still use it.

  comment_content: Excellent article.  Love the bit about linking and the info about
    copywriting "don't put it online at all" if you are worried about copywrite!  So
    true.

  comment_content: I find people to be waaay to scared to do anything these days really
    unless your going to link out to FFA farms and spam porn sites It's good to share
    and the internet is BUILT on links! \n\nLove that 2.0!

  comment_content: I Agree, developing secure &amp; browser complying webpages  is
    a difficult task. Also you should correct the link for examples of vulnerabilities

    comment got blacklisted by spam karma because you linked to google.com, I''ve
    fixed that problem now).'

  comment_content: I'm *really* considering emailing this post round ALL my friends
    in another attempt to let them know how shit IE browsers are.\n\nI check out the
    W3C's browser stats on almost every new project I undertake for clients these
    days, and dread the cross-browser work I 'have' to do for the likes of IE (Surprisingly
    Opera renders really poorly these days too).\n\nIt's just nice to see that almost
    1-in-2 people on the internet now are using Firefox :]\n\nGood post, again, Emil.

  comment_content: '@Lewis Litanzios: Don''t let me stop you, I''d love to have this
    article spread far and wide :) \n\nConcerning cross-browsers stuff: my last project
    was actually one where I didn''t have to build for IE6, which made it a lot less
    painful for everyone involved. I hope everyone could have that pleasure, always.'

  comment_content: 'Jesse (Skinner) gave me some wise words recently regarding this
    issue: ''I don''t code for IE6 any more unless the client specifically asks for
    it. If they do I tell them it''ll cost them extra (And rightly so, for I will
    have to spend at least a day restyling...'').\n\nCode to standards and everything
    will be OK.\n\nOn a side note: Disappointed to see you cut my last post out here
    Emil. I know it contained a link to my ''new'' folio, and you probably interpreted
    it as spam, but I was really after some feedback. Believe it or not I care what
    you think :/\n\nPS. Really interesting, that article, on the Samy worm - do you
    understand all that code? I don''t.'

  comment_content: '@Lewis Litanzios: I''d like to update that to "Code to reason
    first, to standards second". Far to many are standards zealots, and forget all
    about reason (not saying you are one, of course :) ).\n\nAbout the folio link: I
    removed the link because I thought it was out of context. Comments are about comments
    to a main article. As this site is growing (over 2000 RSS subscribers!) I''m thinking
    of adding an optional part where other people can post their articles or sites,
    and ask for feedback. A request for feedback on a portfolio would fit perfectly
    there.'

  comment_content: I interpret; 'code to reason' to mean using common sense - am I
    correct? I *think* I know what a 'standards zealot' is (I'm aware a lot of people
    rely on that phrase to get them work), but I'll rest assured on the fact I'm not
    one of them :]\n\nFair point regarding the comments. It's your blog, you do what
    you want with it. I think a feedback/general comments section tagged onto the
    end of every post would be a good addition (if not a potentially time consuming
    one for you Emil :P).\n\nHave a good day mate!

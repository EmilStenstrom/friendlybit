  comment_content: They will never get any legal content so they are doomed. The same
    spot as Joost has. Something cool, but no content = failure.

    movies, most of them about a year old. Many pretty good ones. So there already
    is content there, real movies.'

  comment_content: A similar service was started few months ago in my country but
    it was closed down for copyright infringement. \n\nDo you think that this type
    of streaming is legal? I mean the cost of those movies must be huge, it's not
    like you buy a bunch DVD's and publish them because that happend to the similar
    project in my countru and you know the "happy ending".\n\nAnyway, from the outside
    the service looks good. Is there any method of testing it if we're not so lucky
    as you are? :-) Cheers!

  comment_content: Thats great that you swedish people are always findout something
    to work in your country.\nBut i promise that also Voddler will be permitted in
    Germany like Spotify is because of licensing restrictions.\n\n"This product is
    not available in your country yet." I can't hear it anymore... :-(

  comment_content: That could be a very cool application, but to bad the beta test
    didn't go so good.  Hopefully they get all the bugs worked out.

  comment_content: Ah, the bitterness.\n\nThe implementation of this is so not thought
    through it smells. Hope it is misused so badly they remove the feature in IE9.

  comment_content: 'Browser heights - been pulling my hair out for this fixed design
    the past few days (http://tinyurl.com/bh8aka). I tell ya - never take fixed layouts
    lightly.\n\nRe: IE. I''ll just keep formatting my machine before every project,
    install the latest of everything, and go down the Firefox &gt; Opera &gt; IE clean
    up route. F**k everyone and everything else, ha-ha. You just have to laugh don''t
    you. After getting stress-related illness last week (I''m sure it was) I''ve decided
    THERE IS more important things in life.\n\nAnother good one G :]'

  comment_content: Unfortunately, not many people realize those factors. It becomes
    harder and harder to explain that to clients, so the internet ends up with a good
    quantity of low quality websites.

  comment_content: Nice post lol.  I remember the days when you only had to worry
    about resolutions at 1024 x 768, now who know what suffers are using.  I've tried
    out the new IE8.  I haven't ran into many websites that needed to be changed to
    IE7 compatibility mode.  The only good thing about the new rendering system is
    that it is a step for IE8 to be more compliant.

  comment_content: '@Anonymous (aka. "Web Design Articles"): Thanks for your comment.
    One minor thing: the name field is for people to write their name in, not to promote
    search keywords like you do. This is not a place for advertisement.'

  comment_content: Great article, nice to know that there are others out there that
    feel the pain of the changing technology. Trying to make quality web design for
    both traditional and mobile browswers is turing me gray :-). Thanks for the post!

  comment_content: Discussing the said changes in web development one by one, yes
    it is true that web development is no more an easy thing to do. Browser heights
    and widths have changed. The relation between the width and height of the user's
    screen is completely unpredictable since now people use internet over mobile phones.
    \n\n     In effect, yes the CSS styling is unpredictable too. So its more difficult
    now in all to design a website.

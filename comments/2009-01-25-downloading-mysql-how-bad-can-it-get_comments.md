  comment_content: I accept that I have to choose between community and enterprise
    since they have to make money somehow, but the os, architecture and mirrors choices
    are just simply annoying.

  comment_content: MySQL-devs maybe surf to much on the Microsoft website? "IE is
    the most popular browser on the most popular OS, and they make it this hard too,
    therefore we will be the most popular database!"\n\n:&gt;

  comment_content: Yes! My train of thought everytime I have to go download it. Couldn't
    put it better myself!

  comment_content: Hilarious.. I typically use sqlite locally and then mysql in production
    (come pre-installed on pretty much any server).

  comment_content: '@Anders Ytterström: Seems likely considering how many steps it
    takes to download IE from microsofts website :). They are not at all as bad as
    MySQL though. Microsoft has lots and lots of products, and a very small part of
    their visitors will likely want to download IE...\n\n@Jamie: I tend to like to
    mirror my production environment as closely as possibly, to prevent errors that
    only show up in production.'

  comment_content: It's much easier if you use our MySQL mirror. It contains both
    enterprise and community releases in a simple directory hierarchy. \n\nhttp://mirror.provenscaling.com/mysql/\n\nYes
    it's perfectly legal to distribute mysql enterprise. It's GPL licensed just like
    the community binaries.

    IBM:s website would feel wrong too. And although it''s a hell of annoying, it''s
    still doable...'

  comment_content: I know. It's bloody annoying isn't it. I install my local work
    environment (PHP, Apache, MySQL, phpmyadmin) manually. But the next time I *do*
    a Wordpress I'm gonna check out an 'all-in-one-install' Server Suite or XAMPP
    package.

  comment_content: Of course, going to the mysql company web site to download mysql
    seems to me like a rather strange exception, certainly not the rule.\n\nThe default
    way is of course to use the package manager of your operating system, and typing
    something like "apt-get install mysql" or "pkgadd mysql" should bee all that's
    needed.

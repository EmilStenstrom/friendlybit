  comment_content: 'Beautiful site! Great layout! Well-written info. Makes me jealous...\nre:
    tabular data in tables. When does  "laying out data clearly" become "layout table"?\nEg.
    one student had a list of pdfs on his page: name/file type/size. That is surely
    tabular data.\nAnother had a price list: name/price/picture.\nAnother had a list
    of items for sale: name &amp; info/picture.\n\nIs there a point when you can definitely
    say "sorry, that''s just layout?" Or is it opinion?'

  comment_content: 'Alistair: That''s a great question. You know that you''ve have
    learned a lot when you start asking that kind of questions.\n\nI tend to think
    of tables as things you would put in an Excel sheet. As a general distinction
    that works fine. Another thing to look at is if it would make sense to put headers
    on the table. If it does you probably have a proper data table. I hope that makes
    sense.'

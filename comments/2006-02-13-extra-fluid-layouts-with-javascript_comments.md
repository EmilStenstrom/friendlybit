  comment_content: Nice, now what if a reload wasn't required? That would certainly
    give it a nice effect.

  comment_content: I remember seeing someone's site that switched from 2 to 3 columns
    and back as the window was resized (using javascript) -- that'd be a good place
    to look for this sort of thing.\n\nWish I could remember which site it was though.

  comment_content: 'zapada: Very few people actually resize the page, that''s one
    of the reasons I decided not to make the code even more complex by adding event
    handling. Keep it simple.'

  comment_content: I've seen some other blogs on this topic and the idea of fluid
    layouts seem very practical today especially since screen sizes vary so much.  More
    specifically, browsers display lots of wasted space on wide aspect ratio screens.  Taking
    advantage of that extra display area is a great thing.  Although, I still wonder
    if having a dynamic layout will confuse users who aren't expecting it.  You know,
    some web users hate change, especially change that occurs from one desktop computer
    to the next.

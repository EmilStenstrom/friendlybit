  comment_content: 'Totally new to me. Thanks. :D\n\nAnd the pessimistic side of mine
    asks the obvious question: Will this ever be supported by IE, and how long time
    will it take if the IE team actually care about it?\n\nFeels like a neat feature
    to find in Trident''s small sibling, though. Together with full support of CSS2.1.'

  comment_content: '@madr: On the positive side, this feature has evolved pretty quickly
    on the mobile side, probably because Opera and Safari (webkit) have a fairly large
    market share there...'

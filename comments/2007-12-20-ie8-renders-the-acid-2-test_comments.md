  comment_content: I'm just worried that they've put everything in to passing the
    Acid2 test and will still deliver the same old crap.\n\nIE7 was nothing more than
    IE6 with tabs and some patches.\nI'm afraid IE8 will be IE7 with Acid2 compliance
    (but all the other crap still in there...).\n\nI just don't want to get my hopes
    up like I did last time.

  comment_content: Maybe because it it doesn't.  There may be a snapshot inside microsoft
    which renders acid 2 perfectly, or they may be lying.  Until they actually deliver
    it, there is no real difference.\n\nOr can I get a copy and check it out for myself?  Today?\n\nUntil
    I can, every version of MSIE sucks big time.  Nothing much to talk about then.

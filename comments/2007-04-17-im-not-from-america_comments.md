  comment_content: I'm also from Sweden, and funnily enough I've managed to avoid
    the kind of people you're talking about, pretty well.\n\nGenerally I share your
    point of view – we look at Americans sort of the same way – they're quite self-centered,
    but I'm not sure I've actually met particularly many of these people. And just
    as Americans tend to think USA is the center of the world Swedes believe Sweden
    is a great country (and so do I), perhaps the best.\n\nStill, thanks for posting
    this – we need some loosening up, all of us. Hugs for all.

  comment_content: I'm American, but not one of what you call "you Americans." Perhaps
    your post would be more friendly if you aimed it more precisely at the people
    who need to hear it (instead of implying that all Americans are like that!).

  comment_content: Wow... you seem angry. :) \nBut I understand exactly where you're
    coming from (as my IP undoubtedly can tell you). What's worse is probably the
    fact that some 84% (or thereabout) of the US population would NOT be ready for
    an atheist president. And how many of those are creationist? Yay self-centered
    de-evolution. :D

  comment_content: It's all about the American Dream. And it's so incredibly funny
    how extremely few of them actually live, or will live, that Dream. They rather
    watch those few 'successful' on TV than have a better life themselves. Get rich
    or live substandard, hoping. Ha ha!

  comment_content: I have to admit, being an American myself, that I often am simply
    just ignorant of what information is common knowledge to me, but not to the rest
    of the world.  It's interesting how you put it though.  If I were to pick up a
    book written in England, for example, I wouldn't understand all of the social
    systems mentioned.  I wouldn't expect to.  The book is written within a particular
    time and context.  I'm not saying that authors shouldn't try to broaden their
    appeal, especially in light of how things are progressing towards a more global
    market, but we also need to just realize that it's impossible to shed one's culture
    when writing.  When I read Shakespeare, for example, I'm expected to understand
    his time and culture.  Why should reading authors today be any different?  I know
    you're not talking primarily about writing par se, but I use this as an example,
    since you mentioned it, that we must each one of us, no matter where we are from,
    seek to understand the other.  I'm glad to learn about your tax system, currency,
    and time difference.  Tell me more!  How does this affect your life?

  comment_content: I'm a web developer from Denmark and can relate to your point of
    view.\n\nI just don't think that the ones you are aiming at, are ever likely to
    read your blog. In fact I think that the Americans that read this blog are quite
    aware of the things you are describing.\n\nOh and by the way, I only consider
    myself a Dane when I practically have to refer to where I come from. Ha ha just
    think of all the confusion if I actually where CONVINCED that I was a Dane - that
    would suddendly breed the notion of "the others out there" and ha ha who knows,
    maybe I would do something stupid someday - like say, to kill some of "these others"
    because I felt disconnected from them. What a terrible misunderstanding. Oh wait...
    did someone do that?

  comment_content: '@Dan Pettersson: As a swede I do like Sweden, and I''m not saying
    Americans shouldn''t like America. What I wish people would do is to broaden their
    vision, and from my experience Americans have a harder time doing that than others.\n\n@Berty:
    Why not? \n\n@grimman: Not angry, rather frustrated. As the US affects the world
    as much that it does, they have a <strong>bigger</strong> responsibility to look
    outside their borders. To become even more self-centered in that position will
    only lead to bad things...\n\n@Chris: I totally agree that you shouldn''t discard
    your culture. But there''s a difference in assuming others have (or want to have)
    the same culture and explaining yours. What I find with American authors more
    than with others, is that they more often assume things about culture. \n\nThat
    said, I want to learn more about all my reader''s cultures, how do I best do that?'

  comment_content: I was really confused when reading the beginning of your post in
    my feed reader :)\n\nSadly (?), I don't know much about the things you tell us
    about. What books do you read? Tell us more about <em>you</em> instead of your
    country only (however, it depresses me you got a 100mbit connection ;)).\nThe
    only book written by an American author that lives in my bookshelf is David Allens
    "Getting Things Done". Every other English/American literature is prose or lyrics.
    And when I think about books that might interest me, I think about "The Pragmatic
    Programmer" or other techy stuff out there. \nI just can't afford these books
    right now. Someone in Germany seems to like the idea of doubling the original
    prices (USD 20 to EUR 45) of books related to PC/Programming.\nAnd  I honestly
    doubt that those books include a lot of cultural aspects.\n\nSo what is your bookshelf
    looking like? "Show me your library and I can tell who you are" or something like
    this someone said once. It's quite true, I think, although I myself am not so
    good at "interpreting" bookshelves :)

  comment_content: I agree with you. I live in Virginia, but have traveled a fair
    bit through Central America and Europe, so my experience is different from many.
    \nI agree that as citizens of the United States, we need to look outside our own
    borders and remember there is a world out there that is not the US. I think a
    lot of people get lost in this country and forget that.\nI was talking with a
    friend from London last night she made the excellent point that we practically
    have to fly to get outside the country, whereas if we were in Europe, we could
    drive from country to country.\nAnd that made a lot of sense. \nAnyway, I'm rambling
    so I'll shut up now. I wish we had the internet speeds and progressive, open government
    in this country that you do in yours.

  comment_content: I'm curious. Was there a specific incident that prompted this post?\n\nOne
    hopes that some reading it might relish the prospect of living in a society where
    taxation is used to provide proper services, where few are in poverty, where free
    education is available to almost anyone, where internet infrastructure is way
    ahead of most other countries, where there is a robust democracy and the electoral
    regulatory agency is not (and cannot be) hijcaked by any political party.\n\nRegrettably,
    few of these features can be found in Australia (which is rapidly turning into
    America).\n\nJag har åkte till Sverige tre gånger och jag gilla det, men jag talar

  comment_content: I recognize this article for some USA civilians, yep, I do, but
    not all.\n\nMore political parties would be very healthy for the USA civilians,
    at least it makes them think again. You're not born republic or democratic, there
    are more political nuances to think about walking around on this earth.\n\nThis
    weak I had a thought the right to self defence, which implies to have weapens
    for civilians, is more worth to USA citizens then learning students which could
    be important for the future. Could they explain this after a year to the parents
    who lost their children? I'm very afraid we only have to wait until a next mental
    not healthy person copy cats the other murderers in another university.\n\nAnd
    yes, it is not only your own excellence which is important, my dear USA, it is
    also looking after you're living and thinking you're collaborating with.

  comment_content: Well, who gives a rat’s ass about them yanks? Yes, their mentality
    is too self-centric (more because of a propaganda), but all in all they are just
    people. And they will learn how to live in a different world, for U.S. is in decline,
    and in for a long, slow, slide down into harsh reality.\n\nP. S. Didn’t see all
    the comments, before I posted, so I wanted to focus on comment 25. There is a
    perfect example of how American propaganda gets to people.\n\nWould I deny that
    America had substatial impact in Allies victory of WW II? No, it is true. But
    first of all, they did it not without self-benefit (war-time economy proppeled
    them out of the Great Depression, and that’s because they didn’t do it for free
    — weaponry, tanks, planes weren’t just give, they were land-leased). Once again,
    not to disregard good will of average American, and the blood they spilled.\n\nBut
    let’s not forget, that they were not the only ones fighting Axis. And let me remind
    you of a country, that not that many Westerners like to mention. I’m talking about
    Soviet Union, that (let me indulge in pathos a bit here) “put on the altar of
    victory” over <strong>25 million lives</strong>, including 18 million Russians.\n\nYes,
    that victory was everybody’s — Russian, British, American, French, and other countries
    that participated. Let’s just remember them all, and not say stupid stuff, like
    Americans single-handedly saved the world from Nazi terror.

  comment_content: You Swedes really need to get off your high horses some time. So
    what if Americans don't want an Atheist president? The fact is that by and large
    we are a spiritual people and are proud of it. Swedes can be so bloody hypocritical.
    You talk about how "open-minded" you are but what you really mean is "We believe
    in anything that is LIBERAL/LEFT OF CENTER". If it's not that "we don't want to
    hear it". The fact is that an openly spiritual/religious Swedish PM is just as
    unlikely to get elected in Sweden as an atheist here. I'm amazed how you can go
    on and on about America but how many "open minded" Swedes have got on the T-bana
    to Rinkeby or Tensta in the past week? I mean really. Stop being so obsessed about
    America. Guess what, besides the gorgeous blonds (I love a backslick stekare any
    day of the week)...what is there to discuss? Yes Americans can be arrogant but
    so can Swedes. So just have a kebab and watch bingo lotto and chill out, will
    you....geez\n\nHaving said that, Joe American, please recognize that half the
    problems we "solve" we "caused" in the first place. There's no reason that a country
    that represents 5% of the population should use 50% of the world's resources.
    Or, that segments of the population have the same infant mortality rates as certain
    countries in the East (ex. Poland)

  comment_content: <strong>Lars</strong>, I’ll repeat it once again — U.S. enjoyed
    huge economical benifit because of this war. Industrial tycoons were selling their
    stuff long before Americans entered the war (Frankly, those guys don’t really
    care whom to sell their stuff. Even now there was scandal of parts for F-14s were
    caught at the customs on the way to Iran.). And after that they had tremendous
    advantage of not having war action on their soil.\n\nAnd, being the only major
    industrial power in the world not ravaged by war, they were able to dedicate their
    resources to production.\n\nAnd funny thing is, that regular American people,
    those who fought, and those who worked day and night at the factories, did so
    because they believed they do it for good. They gave blood, sweat, and tears,
    but industrial tycoons didn’t cut into their profits much.\n\nP. S. 8000 Swedes
    volounteered for Finland in Talvisota (1939-40). ;)

    Perhaps is Swedes (and others) weren''t so obsessed about America, America wouldn''t
    be obsessed about itself. I find it hypocritical how Swedes complain about how
    self-centric America is yet consume so much of what is America. I mean if anything,
    take the lead of France. They too feel the same way about America and that''s
    why there is less consumption of "all things American" there. I feel if so many
    Swedes have certain feelings towards American, demonstrate it with your words.
    Instead of buying "American muffins" at Wayne''s Coffee, by "Canadian" or "Uruguayan"
    (or whatever" muffins. Instead of watching American movies all the time, watch
    South African movies, etc. Instead of everyday writing about what XYZ American
    is doing on the front pages of the newspapers, write about what is happening in
    Finland. And so on, and so forth. But once again, it''s pretty hypocritical to
    talk about how "America sees itself only as the world" when everywhere you look
    in Sweden there so much "Amerification...."\nTack...'

  comment_content: What about China, almost\nthe largest economic force in the world?\n\nI
    think it is lame to bash on the US. US people I met, they were just overly into
    Europe, and could not wait to live permanently here (=Belgium).\n\nSweden is well
    respected for its high living standard and social efforts but I believe you should
    not mix up US foreign policy with US identity = over 50 states with so many different
    cultures and ways...

  comment_content: '@dd ddd: So what you''re saying is that since so many countries
    imitate the US, it has in fact become the world? I don''t pick up China or Sweden
    as examples because I don''t see that mentality there. Sweden has three core courses
    in school, Swedish, Math, and English. We know we can''t cope with only our own
    little language... Accept that the world is larger than your own country, no matter
    what country you live in. Agreed?'

  comment_content: '@ddd,\nUm, I think you are allowing your emotions to cloud objectivity.
    My point is that I think Swedes lie to themselves alot. America bashing is a sport
    in Sweden. Yet, I don''t think you (meaning the collective "you" not "you" personally)
    realize how silly it looks when you all complain about America almost every micro-second
    of the day yet consume everything thing that you can which is "American" while
    you are doing it. There''s a Macdonald''s or 7-Eleven on every corner of Stockholm
    - and you know it. Please don''t mistake my points here.  I am fully aware that
    less than 20% of Americans even have passports and that is a crying shame - I
    think Americans really miss out alot on life. But where we differ in opinion is
    that you seem to think it''s an "American" thing when I  would argue it''s a "human"
    thing. When people cater to you, it makes you lazy -- notice how many thousands
    of Swedes who eat meatballs and listen to SR or watch STV while on holiday in
    Spain every year. Since they know they are going to be catered to, most don''t
    bother learning even though they''ve been there every year for the past 10+ years.
    This is just a small example. I guess the point I am making is that I think it
    is down right foolish how obsessed Swedes appear with regard to criticizing America/-cans
    given how much you embrace culture. It would be like me walking around criticizing
    the French when I openly embrace everything French. So, I feel for all those Swedes
    who feel the way you do, you should avoid being hypocritical by bad-mouthing a
    country one minute, then imitating it the next. Seriously dude, it looks so stupid.  I
    always chuckle when I watch Swedish television and one minute they ae talking
    about the shitty things America is doing then bring up some lame story about what
    such-and-such American celebrity is doing the next. I mean if Americans complained
    about Swedes the way Swedes complain about Americans, there would be no way in
    hell we''d be imitating them!!!'

  comment_content: Wow! What a thread. As an American by birth, I don't take offense
    to Emil's thoughts. But you also must remember that our country is a country of
    immigrants. I like Fredrik's comment "People from USA are only Europeans with
    a little more land." So funny, at least we started out that way. Until recently
    most of us didn't need passports to travel to Canada or even Mexico. And yes,
    travelling around the 50 states but staying in our country does make a us spoiled
    and a little clueless to the rest of the world. But we exist because your ancestors
    and mine wanted a better life and religious freedom. I think most people who do
    come to America now still come for that reason. Yes, we need to raise our children
    more aware of their world, and not just of middle-east conflict. But our public
    schools have suffered from short sighted, money saving views. Our children aren't
    taught the arts and even physical education has been phased out in some states.
    In California where I live (which, by the way is NOT all Hollywood) our schools
    have to teach to 'state standards' and little time for much else. The PEOPLE of
    the United States know that for all the 'stuff' we have, we've given up a lot
    of our soul. Our parents and their parents made sure we had better lifes and ours
    and the next generations turned that into being spoiled. The bright side - despite
    all this, contrary to what you hear mostly about us, our teens are becomming people
    who are serious and empowered to make the changes needed to improve our world
    and the world around us. We know it's there.

  comment_content: I have lived in American most of my life (I am American). But my
    mother is Swedish.\n\nWhat most Europeans don't take into consideration, is that
    the average American, doesn't travel. My wife had never seen snow until our honeymoon.
    I have a co-worker who is 30 and he has never seen an ocean. Most Americans don't
    wander far from where they were born. When I tell people that I was born in Germany,
    they assume my father was in the military (and they would be right).\n\nMy mother
    is the only reason I have traveled outside of the United States. She taught me
    how important it is to experience different cultures and people.\n\nI was visiting
    some of my family in Sweden several years ago in Uppsala (sp) I was in a great
    little pub and met a dozen or so college students. I think we spoke till almost
    morning. I taught them American slang and they taught me Swedish customs. It was
    an amazing evening of drinking and laughing. I also sold the Levis 501 jeans that
    I was wearing for a 100 USD.\n\nMost Americans just need to get out an experience
    the rest of the world.

  comment_content: i like ur post... but i think a new point for this frustration
    is that they assume "global view" = china / india. so, instead of not knowing
    "what the rest of the world means", these "Americans" (in quotation marks, not
    everyone, not a particular person, just on average), they now thought that "rest
    of the world" = China/ India and at best Europe = France.

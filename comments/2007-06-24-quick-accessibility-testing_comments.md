  comment_content: Brilliant roundup. Thanks for the tip about Fangs, that looks like
    a very useful extension. Another Firefox add-on I like to plug whenever given
    the opportunity is the <a href="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/" rel="nofollow">HTML
    Validator</a>\nIt is a very discreet plugin that lets you see at a glance if a
    page's HTML validates. You can set it to run two parsers, HTML Tidy, and SGML
    (which is identical to the W3C validator). It highlights any errors in your source
    code, and gives very helpful advice on how to fix problems.

  comment_content: '@Jonathan Nicol: Agreed! It certainly is a good extension that
    deserves extra promotion! (although it is in the list already, first point, Bonus

  comment_content: Checking keyboard navigation of a webpage is I often find one of
    the quickest  and easiest ways to identify problems with a web page. Just starting
    from the top, hit the tab key, and if there are some seriously bad accessibility
    issues with the page, watch the links which get missed, the buttons that get skipped
    over, or links or edit fields in a form which suddenly come up in an order which
    renders the meaning of, E.G., a form unintelligible.\nPersonally also, I find
    the HTML and CSS markup validation tools vital, as whichever pages your looking
    at, no matter how 'accessible' they might be in the way they're designed, it all
    counts for nothing if they've not even got the markup validating.\nAlso, with
    seemingly so many online and toolbar/extention based accessibility tools about
    now, I always feel its best to run at least a handful of pages of any given website
    through a wide range of them, as what one identifys, another might not, and visa

  comment_content: Yeah, this is a neat trick, but it is not user-friendly.  IMHO,
    tooltips in general are poor design elements.  The main problem is that there
    is no way the user will know that hovering over a particular part of the screen
    will show a tooltip.  Somebody out there is going to make the mistake of hiding
    information essential to understanding the content in the tooltip, and then they
    will wonder why people don't understand what they made.  At the same time as you
    design this tooltip mechanism, you need to think about how the user is going to
    know it exists.  After you think about that, you'll probably decide never to use
    tooltips.

  comment_content: '@Shailesh: I wouldn''t dismiss tooltips that easiliy. You''re
    absolutely right that one should be careful not not to hide important information
    in there, but that doesn''t mean they''re not helpful. Tooltips are good when
    your information is in two layers, one that works as an overview and one that''s
    more specific. Instead of showing all the info at once, making the page cluttered
    you can chose this method of only showing the overview and show a little more
    info when the use hovers it. Or simpler: Showing too much info could be bad too.\n\nAnother
    place where tooltips are useful is when using the title attribute. Setting a title
    can give more info about a link just before the user decides to click it. Are
    you against title too?'

  comment_content: This doesn't work too nicely at Opera Browser. Picture is not cleared
    when you hover off.

  comment_content: I work on a project which generates some reports based on statistical
    data. These reports are usually bulkier ( about 500 rows with atleast 10 columns).
    I want to be able to set tooltip on each cell but dont want in the title attribute
    as it will increase the size of HTML. JavaScript way of getting all elements based
    on a class name and then setting the title attribute is also not ideal because
    it will make the user interaction slower. \n\nIs there any way to denote tooltips
    completly in CSS for table cells?

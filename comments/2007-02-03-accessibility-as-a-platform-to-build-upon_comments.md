  comment_content: Whenever I think of getting into multimedia more, I think of SMIL.
    I wish browsers suppported it, because I really think it could be accepted by
    regular users and it wouldn't require authors to know any javascript to accomplish
    a few simple things. Nice article/entry.

  comment_content: I couldn't agree more, some great points raised. This extra layer
    of non unobtrusive interaction is just what the doctor ordered.

  comment_content: 'Who are "we" really: web designers, under 25, MTV viewers?\n\nWho
    are "those" in accessibility that advocate ruling out everything but plain HTML?\n\nAnd
    do "we" really want more interactivity?\n\nMTV users, who you would expect to
    want an all-singing all-dancing flash site, obviously don''t:\n<a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/MTV_Launches_New_HORRIBLE_Flash_Design\n\nhttp://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/004180.php\n\nCould"

    it be that "we" want to Interact with your site, rather than have your site "interact"
    upon us?\n\nPersonally, I''m not opposed to beautiful looking things, but I prefer
    to be able to submit a form, copy some content, or understand where to go next
    over partial page reloads and animation.'

  comment_content: '@Terrence Wood: You''re missing the point, this article is about
    having both plain HTML and adding another layer on top of that with effects. When
    you build like that it''s easy to give people like you an option of turning off
    the top layer.\n\nAnd to answer your rhetoric questions, you know exactly what
    kind of people I talk about, don''t be silly.'

  comment_content: '@Terrance Wood: What you say you''d prefer (or I, for that matter)
    is largely irrelevant. The presentation methods that get the most commercially
    relevant responses from us will inevitably become prevalent. Currently the flashier
    online experiences, like those requiring that extra layer, are achieving results.
    They overshadow the older, duller, understated methods. Like it or not, animation
    and multi-media are becoming the standard. perhaps you just haven''t seen them
    used well? Or perhaps used well, they are so easily overlooked?'

  comment_content: If can handle a little bit of coding jargon, have some designer
    sense, and have some human feelings then you are a front-end developer ! Quite
    similar to my character.

  comment_content: Excellent article! I found myself looking for characteristics of
    all of these in the people in my office (I'm one of the designers, and yes, totally
    fits my character), and found them all to be fairly true. \n\nGreat break from
    the more "serious" articles!

  comment_content: okay. how on earth do you get one to date you? Good people, a sprinkle
    of nerd, brilliant big picture thinkers who work directly with some of the smartest

  comment_content: '[...] Heureusement, Emil Stenström vient de sauver ma vie sociale
    avec son billet Why you should date a front end developper et sa définition du
    métier de webdesigner&nbsp;: These are the people that get frowned upon for being
    bad programmers, lousy designers, and for knowing too little about usability.
    Truth is, they still they manage to ship sites that actually work. They tend to
    be good at coding, but not in the way programmers are used to. While they don’t

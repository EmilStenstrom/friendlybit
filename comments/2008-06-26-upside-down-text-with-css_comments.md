  comment_content: How come I never knew about this? I've looked through the spec
    and found some gems, but this... this is like... awesome! I'm shocked it doesn't
    even seem familiar to me. Thanks

    upside-down text?

  comment_content: Your link to the specification doesn't go to a W3C page -- instead
    it goes to a third-party's fun-with-upside-down-text page, which doesn't answer
    my question about real examples.

  comment_content: '@Spamboy: Is that so? Why on earth would I link to a fun page
    on an issue this serious? A real-world example would be a reflection of some text
    that has to be user-defined. Could make for a dynamic Web 2.0 logo :)'

  comment_content: LOL.\n\nActually, beeing able to rotate text 90° (or an arbitrary
    value) would be really usefull ...\n\nFor some text, you don't even need fancy
    unicode-compatible browsers ...\n\numop apisdn 'sdoo

  comment_content: If its undocumented, its probably because it doesn't garentee to
    work on all PCs. Like mine. I get a few upside down characters, but most are replaced
    with boxes (i.e. missing characters)

  comment_content: Just today was a new Drupal module released to achieve this exact
    same thing (http://drupalmodules.com/module/upside-down). My question is the same
    as everyone else's it seems - Why the hell would I want to do that?!

    had one of those stupid newsletters with a question-and-answer section. Like,
    "How many comments on this article were facetious? A: 6; B: 42; C: All of them;
    D: Turtles." Then have an answer key later on the page, with the text upside down.
    Really useful stuff.'

  comment_content: Actually, you can see in the source code that he manually wrote
    the text on it's inverse "property" - if it had been for real, he would have written
    the normal-looking text inside the following  instead of the inverse values. :)\n\n?x??
    u?op ?p?sdn ?????\n\nHow come no one noticed this?

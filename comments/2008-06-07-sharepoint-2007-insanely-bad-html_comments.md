  comment_content: Ok, if you posted this on April 1, I never would have believed
    any of it. It's just... <em>not ...believable</em>. But since it's June, I'm laughing
    so hard right now that I think I might pee my pants.

  comment_content: Reminds me of the html that frontage would spew out.  A page with
    one word would be 6k...

  comment_content: Omg, that is absolutely horrible. Why would any sane person choose
    to use Sharepoint?

  comment_content: Absolutely unbelievable!?! I couldn't even read this whole post.
    I can't even see the humour in it because it is just so bad.\n\nI can't even comprehend
    how this corporation succeeds. I'd be interested in hearing their defense and
    justification for such sloppy workmanship. SHAMEFUL!

  comment_content: Well our company bought sharepoint, we get to deal with this and
    hundreds more frustrations every day.\nIf you think the HTML is bad, wait until
    you actually work with the rest of it...

  comment_content: Dude, you just got EVERY web developer that stumbles this page
    to go "OH SHIT, what if my site's next??" - but after reading it i can tell that
    this is way worse than anything you could find in my app. Anyway shitty tools
    output shitty code - this would never have happened in Rails.

  comment_content: '@sikanrong: I''m not sure what you mean but I think this is bigger
    than a Microsoft vs. Open source argument (anything Microsoft did vs. Rails).
    Microsoft do good things and bad things, this is the worst thing they have ever
    produced!\n\nIn other words, I agree :)'

  comment_content: I sure agree that the code in WSS and MOSS is terrible, if not
    [ insert your WORST NIGHTMARE]. But I still believe that the idea behind all this
    is great!\n\nWe are going to use Sharepoint really soon as it integrates nicely
    into our new AD/Exchange-Network. I just got a decent helpdesk up and running
    in a bout 30minutes. The technology is good, the implementation (code) is bad.
    That's M$ technology. We have to live with it [DAMN]...\n\nWhat really annoys
    me about this, is the fact that they just released MOSS 2007 a couple months ago...

  comment_content: 'Developing "custom" code for MOSS is a painful experience too.
    There''s no way to use the SharePoint.dll remotely, all interaction development
    that requires it''s use means that you have to have Visual Studio installed on
    that server to even begin to think about it.\n\nAlso if you don''t want to go
    that route... they have web services... unfortunately those have a fairly steep
    learning curve when you have to use CAML to create/update/delete lists. Consider
    the following as well: for a system that seems to want to be the a central document
    storage system for team collaboration... they might want to have a web service
    that would allow for programmatically doing bulk file uploads to a document library...
    but they don''t.'

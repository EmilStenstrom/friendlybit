  comment_content: LOL!! OH MY! That's classic. I've seen some horrid code before,
    but I never ever imagined anything like this. As soon as I saw the code, I just
    sat there with a blank stare and my jaw hanging open and blinked a few times as
    I tried to get a grip on reality again. You just created a work of art.

  comment_content: What exactly does "CSS looks like it’s taken straight from Dreamweaver"
    look like? CSS is CSS. I'm not sure how you could tell it apart. DW doesn't add
    anything to hand-coded CSS.

  comment_content: '@Blather: Dreamweaver does not do smart CSS. It  generates classes
    and absolute position them all until they are exactly where you''ve said they
    should be. That obviously does not work.'

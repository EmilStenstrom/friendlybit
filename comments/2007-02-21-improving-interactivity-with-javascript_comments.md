  comment_content: This is almost a feature list of what you can do <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-forms-2/#introduction0">declaratively
    with Web Forms 2.0</a>. :-)

  comment_content: '@zcorpan: Well, except for the fact that this works and Web Forms
    2.0 is way off into the future :) I see a lot not in that list either... Interesting
    spec though.'

  comment_content: Well let's see...\n\n<strong>Slider:</strong> &lt;input type=range&gt;.\n\n<strong>Date
    picker:</strong> &lt;input type=date&gt;.\n\n<strong>Smart text boxes:</strong>
    Depending on what you want to allow in the text field you could use different
    type="", and/or you could use pattern="". Whether it will be possible to enter
    other things is up to the UA really -- the spec only says what can be sent to
    the server.\n\n<strong>Mixing text inputs with select boxes:</strong> &lt;datalist&gt;.
    (This is designed in a way that you can make it degrade nicely in legacy UAs --
    basically you can take the scripted version you have now and slap a &lt;datagrid&gt;
    around it and Opera users will get a native UI.)\n\n<strong>Drag and Drop:</strong>
    This has been used since MS invented it, but it has never actually been specced
    until now in HTML5.\n\n<strong>Collapse and expand control:</strong> &lt;details&gt;
    in HTML5.\n\n<strong>Advanced tooltips:</strong> Hmm... Perhaps you could use
    XBL2 for this.\n\n<strong>Autosaving form fields:</strong> This should IMHO be
    a browser feature (and indeed I think at least Opera and/or Firefox has it).\n\n<strong>Auto
    validation:</strong> With the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes you can indicate
    which fields are valid and which are not.\n\n<strong>Controls affecting each other:</strong>
    I think this was considered but rejected for WF2; it still has to be scripted.\n\n<strong>Image
    handling:</strong> I guess you could do even more with &lt;canvas&gt; from HTML5.
    :-)\n\n<strong>Search-based or structured navigation:</strong> This seems like
    it would be implemented on the server (or with Ajax).\n\n<strong>Better looking
    form fields:</strong> Well, this is the domain of CSS, really. But perhaps XBL2
    will be supported before browsers allow more styling of form controls.\n\n<strong>Sortable
    items:</strong> Drag and drop again.\n\nOk, you're right, some things aren't in
    WF2, but with backup from Web Applications 1.0 and XBL2 most things are covered.
    And yes, you're right, those specs are still very new and not implemented in many
    browsers yet.\n\nSorry if I took this slightly off-topic; I couldn't help it.
    ;-)

  comment_content: I think when the browsers start implementing these other widgets
    we will hear a lot of complaints about how these things look, so I think the JavaScript
    equivalents will always have relevance. At least Web Forms will let the fallback
    solution be a bit more useful than a text box.

  comment_content: Great list Emil. One item I miss on the list is dropdown-replacements.
    Yahoo! calls them "split buttons". See example "split button" on YUI. Also used
    on chat list in GMail.\n\nI think they come in handy, when you need something
    in between an autocomplete field and a traditional dropdown field.

  comment_content: Very cool!\n\nAlso I've done some resizable tables with dragable
    columns and reordering etc. Was for a prototype and a one-off, but it was done
    and it worked quite nice!\n\nRegards

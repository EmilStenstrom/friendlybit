  comment_content: Thank you for this review. I was wondering if you could say more
    about the storage - which is basically the biggest stumbling block for me when
    it comes to life logging. Where is the data stored and how can it be accessed?
    I figure that since any site can be hacked, your data could potentially be stolen.
    Following the logic of most hacking, the biggest companies with the most data
    (like LinkedIn or Evernote in their respective fields) would be targeted first.\n\nPersonally,
    I prefer to have a say in how I store my data and where. I would love for a lifelogger
    to give me the alternative to either save the data locally or on a cloud server
    of my choice. I wonder if such a solution even exists on the market today.\n\nHowever,
    in your review you mention that "At the end of the day you connect it to your
    computer, which uploads the images to private, encrypted, image storage". Do you
    have a choice to simply transfer the files to your local computer instead of storing
    it on the cloud? \n\nThank you

  comment_content: Me too. I tried <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> to Refresh the page
    completely, but nothing seemed to change.\n\n(EDIT) This is a test of the edit
    feature.\n\nI used the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> element to style the references
    to "Ctrl" and "F5"  in the text above, and they submitted correctly.  However,
    they seem to have been removed by the edit action.\n\nI am adding them back in
    now.\n\n(EDIT2) They have not been removed this time. Submitting again.\n\n(EDIT3)
    Still fine. This is a pretty neat system, I especially like the "<strong>EDITING</strong>"
    label being added to the message I am editing. :-)

  comment_content: Great work, Emil.  I'd like to spend a bit of time looking at my
    site and really beefing up accessibility features -- in detail, as you have.  Perhaps
    this is the inspiration I need...

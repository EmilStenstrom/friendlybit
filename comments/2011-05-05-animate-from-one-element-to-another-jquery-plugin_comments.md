  comment_content: Hi Maria. No, I create a gray semitransparent rectangle with the
    same size as the target element, and animate that one to the cart. It looks like
    it's the product moving, but it really isn't. It's an easy fix to animate the
    real product instead.

  comment_content: '@Mike w3c schools does have some great tutorials on things, but
    not so much on jquery.  You might want to take a look at jquery''s main doc: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery.'

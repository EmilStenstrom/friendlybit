  comment_content: '@Johan Forngren: My writing wasn''t as clear as the image at the
    bottom: I''m looking for something like on twitter.com; the number of people that
    retweeted, not each individual retweet. I''ve indicated that in the sketch with
    a small number to the right of the retweet icon.'

  comment_content: Agreed!\n\nGoogle+ support would be my 2 pence!\n\nAlso, in my
    Android app I can have a stream (in one column) of Twitter and Facebook posts,
    how do I emulate this in one single column on the desktop version?

    a chance to get in now that Twitter has bought TweetDeck. Why help competitors?'

  comment_content: '@Emil Stenström: You''re right but Tweetdeck already supports
    Facebook, can''t see why they''d stop. It''s better than the Facebook app so lots
    of FB users use it.'

  comment_content: I like the dots in the Android version of Tweetdeck that indicates
    columns with unread tweets. It should be possible to add that (as an option) to
    the top bar where there is unused space. But as you say it's not as important
    on a computer.

  comment_content: '@Jonathan Thomas: Remember that Twitter is a competitor to Facebook.
    If they remake the whole app (I think they will), should they keep Facebook support
    or rebuild it from scratch. I''m not sure they will keep it...'

  comment_content: Add Google+ support right now.  I'm already hating having to monitor
    two channels, "buzz" is already in here, just swap it out with Google+ please.

  comment_content: I'm not sure that's possible, because Google+ has no API yet. I'm
    hoping they will when that's done...

  comment_content: I agree, tweetdeck is by far the best twitter desktop client. I
    would however argue that the official twitter application for the mac is a very
    close second! It is very user friendly and looks amazing!

  comment_content: The Google+ is sort of in beta stage. They shared it with a few

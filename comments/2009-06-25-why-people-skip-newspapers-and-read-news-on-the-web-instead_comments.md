  comment_content: Generally, I agree with you, although I like the physical feel
    and freedom of a newspaper. Probably as a contrast to the digital life I lead...
    :-)\n\nI find that one problem, however, with news articles online is that they
    tend to get updated, at best, a few times. Usually, they're still left with factual
    faults, incorrect links etc, but the writers had to hurry on to new news.\n\nThis
    is probably even worse, since newspapers are temporary and then thrown away (or
    kept for nostalgia, but that's a completely different story... :-) ), whereas
    articles online stick around forever, indexed by search engines, linked to etc
    - all while in a less than perfect/up-to-date format.\n\nBut maybe some in-between
    solution would be portable digital news readers, like tablet PC:s, where you could
    update the content via Wifi/3G, adapt it to your needs, follow links and such?

  comment_content: I've recently started to view newspapers as a middlehand between
    the news producers and the consumers. (ofcourse the producer - consumer definition
    gets less and less relevant as everybody is merging into prosumers)\n\nHere is
    the strategy i would propose for a newspaper ready to change everything (though
    i would guess those are rare, based on my experience with other organisations)
    is to cut most of the overhead costs and let every journalist create and interact
    with it's own readers. Much like a blog, but create close interaciton between
    the diffrent blogs, with references, sales of ads etc.

  comment_content: '@Robert Nyman: Yeah, newspapers are trying very hard to copy what
    they do on paper, to the web! Perhaps it''s time to do it the other way around?\n\nI''m
    not really sure some mix of paper and web is the right one either. People have
    spoken about "digital paper" for ages without anything happening. Maybe newspapers
    should just surrender and go all web?'

  comment_content: '@Kristoffer Nolgren: That''s one way of looking at it. I think
    one of the weak points of that view is that newspapers are one-way, something
    that the web is built to avoid. I too think that using the web to interact directly
    with readers will be more and more common. Exciting times!'

  comment_content: 'This is a very relevant article to something that''s happening
    right now in The Netherlands.\n\nMaybe you have read about it : Some Dutch researchers
    / newspaper lobbyists from last century were sent out on a (gouvernment sponsored)
    mission to figure out ways to give newspapers a boost into the 21st century)\n\nWhat
    did they come up with? A plan to tax everyone that owns an internet connection
    for a couple of euros, because ''news is not free''. LOL\n\nMy Opinion? Newspapers
    are kind of like the RIAA, the need for it will end within a couple of years.'

  comment_content: Obviously newspapers can't focus on the web instead of paper. That's
    why they're called newspapers - paper *is* their identity. Which is also why newspapers
    will die. News on the other hand will live strong and forever. There will always
    be news, each and every day (more or less relevant), it's their inherent nature.
    And even some of the old news organizations might survive. However, the paper
    part is a dead tree. We'd better make sure to bury those newspapers in a casket
    made of iron - burying them in one made of tree would simply be too sadistic.
    Newspapers are dead, long live news!

  comment_content: Newspapers are not dead and will not do that any time soon, they'll
    simply evolve. \n\nBooks, radio, vinyl are all here with us, released from a heavy
    commercial pressure they rediscovered a stronger, deeper bond with us.\n\nThere
    might be a glimpse of where a newspaper can find it's place, in a story, when
    on an average Wednesday that a very serious Israeli newspaper conducted a very
    wild experiment... http://www.forward.com/articles/107571/

  comment_content: '@SchizoDuckie: I hadn''t heard about that, and it''s a shame they
    let those kind of people even near a computer. The music industry already have
    a tax like that in place (in Sweden at least), let''s not expand it to news too
    :(\n\n@Jamie Appleseed: Well, some would say that "News" are the newspaper industry
    identity, and skip (or down prioritize) the "paper" bit. I agree with you, there
    will always be a need for news is some form. Newspapers need to answer the question:
    How do people want their news delivered today?\n\n@Andrey Zhukov: That''s up to
    each and every newspaper to choose: will we change, or keep doing what we''ve
    always done? From what I''ve seen the last five years, I think that picked not
    doing anything.\n\nThat said, there seem to be exceptions. The Israeli newspaper
    cited in your article, is surely onto something. If distribution is what newspapers
    are for, why not distribute other''s news? Like writers and poets. Love it, and
    hope to see more of that here in Sweden!'

  comment_content: I would have to say that I skip the newspaper and go straight to
    the web.  I biggest reason is that I'm only interested in a small section that
    is included in a newspaper or the newspaper doesn’t cover what I’m interested
    in.  You can find a news site or a blog about any type of topic you are interested.    I
    will agree that newspapers are slow.  You can have your news instantly on the
    web, without waiting for the latest edition of the newspaper.

  comment_content: Newspapers will never go away - what about the reasons people read
    print as opposed to the web. People worried about drummers being replaced by drum
    machines too.

  comment_content: I agree that newspapers need to become relevant in order to survive.
    I just use RSS for the business news articles from www.oregonlive.com and have
    little need to actually buy my local newspaper.

  comment_content: Newspapers are going down sooner or later. Nowdays in a well developed
    society a huge procent of people have an internet connection and why should they
    buy a real newspaper when they can read the same thing, updated hundreds of times
    per day, in the online version of a jurnalist blog.\n\nI don't think that a real
    method exist for the newspapers to regain their position over the online media.

  comment_content: Occasionally, buying newspapers is still a must just to keep off
    my eyeballs at the computer but of course, there is more information found online.
    Why spend and waste paper if you can read news online?

  comment_content: Newspapers give you what they want you to read plus they have to
    publish something even if they don't have something to say.\n\nWith RSS feeds
    you can get access to a lot of information and can easy filter out the "noise"

  comment_content: I stopped reading paper newspapers when I got my iphone some time
    ago. They obviously need to change and adapt to the times in many ways on so many
    levels.

  comment_content: I think that "newspaper" is used in as a blanket term. Does the
    NY Times, Chicago Trib, San Fran Chron have problems, the answer is yes. They
    simply are too big, too much overhead. But small town local news is not always
    readily available on the net. Small local newspapers are where it's at. Plus small
    town advertisers want to see their ad in a paper sitting on a table in a coffee
    shop. They don't care and don't believe in Analytics from some salesmen. They
    want to see that paper laying around. They want to see that coupon cut out and
    brought into their store, that's how they measure if their advertising dollar
    is working or not. In my opinion big circ newspapers are in big trouble. Smaller
    niche papers will do fine for a very long time.

  comment_content: Very thought provoking reasons you have given as to why people
    like to read news on websites rather than going for a newspaper. Although for
    some newspaper should be kept completely separate from the digital and technological
    world.↵↵       But yes, if you want to sift news quickly than online news is the
    best thing you can go for. It takes hell of a time to go for the relevant articles
    and then find the remaining part on the inside pages. Moreover relevant news also
    comes up on websites. The opinion that newspapers are static and slow is a good
    argument since the news we are reading is "actually" yesterday's and if something
    happens (a breaking news) the so-called newspaper readers also go and check websites.↵

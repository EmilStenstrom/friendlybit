  comment_content: '@A, Paul: A friend of mine tried to install py-mysql via ports.
    Problem was, port has their own version of things that get downloaded as dependencies
    pf py-mysql. So after the installation you will have multiple versions of python
    and mysql. You can just start to guess the implications of maintaining double
    paths, finding out that easy_install works towards another python install, and
    so on. It''s not worth it!'

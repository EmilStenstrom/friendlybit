  comment_content: '@Thomas: Thanks alot. I''ve only got positive comments so far
    so I''m hoping my articles really do help people.\n\n@Velaluke: Good suggestion.
    I generally code for IE 6, FF 1.5 and Opera 8.5 and test in all those browsers.
    So that''s what I mean. The layouts to the right work in those browsers too. Thanks
    for commenting.'

  comment_content: How can I view the CSS for the examples ?\n\nI'm using Konqueror
    now but usually use Opera (by choice) and FireFox - but have to develop for IE6.\n\n:\nI
    use tables generated by a program and separate pages for printing using  (between
    tables) with the body background set to grey - this shows the paging the user
    will get when printed.\n(div {page-break-after:always} )\n\nHow can I change this
    to floated columns (cells really)- or should I stay with tables ?

  comment_content: Emil,\n\nThanks for putting your ideas out for everyone to see.  I
    really like your clear, straightforward manner of presenting the key ideas.  Also
    - your code formatting is crisp and clean too, making it that much easier to understand
    and maintain.  Do you do this manually (not a big deal for your small sample sites
    - but can be an issue for larger sites)?  If not - can you share with us what
    editor/development tools you use?  Thanks!

  comment_content: '@Inge, Sin, Ben: Thanks! Always nice to hear that you like that
    site.\n\n@Ben: I have done a couple of larger sites too and CSS is just fine to
    use there too. On larger sites you might want to a one global, one module specific
    and even one page specific stylesheet. That makes the site very flexible in design.
    I use an editor called TopStyle for my CSS editing, it''s availiable as a "Lite

  comment_content: I am speechless; your 4-step intro to CSS has managed to do what
    dozens of large 'expert' websites couldn't put together in a simple form for all
    people to understand. After reading your tutorial I really favour your 2/3 col
    div-based designs as opposed to using tables. So far I ve been using tables as
    I couldn't get my head around using divs. A few last questions; float-float vs
    float-margin - are there any implications across different screen resolutions?
    For example there an approximate 45% of users using 1280x1024, 35% -&gt; 1024x768,
    10% -&gt; 1600x1200 and 10% -&gt; 800x600. I want my design to accommodate for
    all, including the extremes 1600x+ as well as the 'old' '800x' (I belong in that
    10% :-( ). What I want to ensure that the 'below-the-float' wont happen across
    larger resolutions, as well as no scrollbars will appear on 800x600 (I hate scroll
    bars). Considering all these who is the best method to go with, f-f or f-m? Is
    it possible to use % (percentages) instead of px while defining margins and widths
    for each of our divs?\n\nSorry for the long comments that considerably stretched
    this left div:)\n\nRegards.

  comment_content: It would also be interesting to know how to design this gorgeous
    link highlighting found at www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ . I tried to follow the CSS used
    for them but failed miserably as I encountered 2-4 CSS files which would take
    me a day to follow:-( Its amazing though the degree of flexibility and potential
    when you use CSS instead of other deprecated HTML tags!

  comment_content: '@Jason: If you use f-m or f-f does not matter really, they work
    equally well. \n\nTo accomodate different resultions I usually do like on this
    site, use a width that is set in the "em" unit. I try to make the dafult size
    work in 800x600 (I know that''s not true for this site) and then let people with
    higher resolutions use the text-zoom. Percents works too but then you need to
    take care to not make your lines too long, that has readability implications.
    \n\nThe mouseover effect changes color, background-color and border on the link.
    It''s simply done with: \n<code lang="html">a:hover { color: white; background:
    grey; border: 2px solid red; }</code>\n\nThanks for dropping by.'

    frustrating; I change the document type from HTML 4.01 to XHTML Strict 1, IE breaks

  comment_content: 'Hi Emil,\nAnother (probably) silly question by me: on the 3column
    f-m method you use  id=header in the body but you haven''t got any declarations
    for "header" in the CSS - does that mean that it understands what "header" is?
    What if you want to remove the border from the header i.e. when you want to have
    an image logo occupying say 780px of width? Also by not using the "" at the begining
    of the page does it have any implications on XML - the feed maybe? If I include
    that line, the design you have for f-m 3-col, just breaks in IE... Sorry if my
    comments were silly; it is just I was still unclear about a few things.'

    rel="nofollow">cross browser tutorial</a> you can''t have <strong>anything</strong>
    before the doctype, it needs to be the first thing in the file. Try reading the
    error the validator gives you, those often help. \n\nAdding "header" is just a
    way for me to give the div some kind of label and make it easy to use from your

    want to remove the border from the header.'

  comment_content: Overall, good and helpful article.  Question regarding modifying
    tags in the CSS.  I want to set the  tag to give me a specific width line (size=4)
    and color.  I added the following code:\nHR\n{\n   color:#F78400;\n   size:4\n}\nto
    the CSS, and inserted  in my HTML file, the color was set properly, but not the
    size.  Is there a way to set the size.  Is there a good on-line reference for
    what properties of tags can be reset in CSS?

  comment_content: I note that in the three column example that you use px for the
    width of the columns.  On my three column site, which is based on a very drastically
    altered standard blogger template that now bears no resemblance to the original
    two-column template, I use percentages.  I believe, perhaps wrongly, that this
    means all browsers and sizes of screens will be able to view the pages as I intend.  In
    using percentages, I note that I cannot get the three columns to sum to 100% but
    something slightly less.  I am uncertain why this is the case.  If I try for 100%
    then I end up the third column - i.e. on the right - dropping below the left-hand
    column.

  comment_content: '@Levi: I used pixels for a very simple reason, people know how
    they work. On most of my pages I use "em" instead but that takes some explaination
    so I just skipped it in these templates. \n\nThe problem with 100% you mention
    is often caused by small things like borders. According to CSS the real width
    of an element is the width you have set plus margins, borders, and paddings. So
    if you set a width of 100% and a border of 1px your layout may break. There''s
    also a bug in IEs way of calculating widths that makes IE even worse to work with
    and the solution to that is to simply use the float-margin method. That way you
    only need to set the width of one of the columns and it doesn''t really matter
    exactly how wide the other one is, it at least won''t drop down.'

  comment_content: Thank you for the quick comment.  Another point on width if it
    is not too much trouble - I note that where you use 3 or even 4 columns you leave
    a large part of the page unused, concentrating images and text in the centre 60%
    or so of the available width.  If you look at my pages, you will see that I use
    100% of total page width.  Is that just a design point?

  comment_content: 'hi, thanks for the tutorial on css, I was following along great
    until I reached your simple layouts page where you show examples of the floating
    234 columns. You only provide examples of the html code, which is clear, but you
    do not provide the css to show how you are using the float features, as besides
    float: left, and float: right, you make references to (float-float) and float-margin
    without showing how to display this properly in the css file. Its one of the common
    themes I am founding with programming tutorials, they do not follow logical progression
    with examples, and start making assumptions knowing that there is so much room
    for error when it comes to programming. If you showed the css that supports your
    simple layout samples that would make things lot clearer, as what you wrote does
    not make any sense, and float-float of float-margin do not properly explain how
    to document them in css file. thanks!'

  comment_content: Hi, I'm kind of used to employing tables to make my design layouts.
    I realise it isn't "the right way" to do this and I started looking for a way
    to do the same thing with CSS. You see, I'm more of a graphic designer and not
    a developer, so the final look is what is important to me most. The problem I
    face is that I haven't come across a technique to define complex graphic design
    with CSS. If you use a border with CSS it is a one solid border all along one
    side, but what if I need to make it gradually fade to background colour towards
    the top of a box? With tables it is simple - place a fading gif in a table cell
    and the job is done. Lets say www.ardo.lt - how do you define design like this
    with CSS? Any suggestions or links to advanced CSS with advanced design techniques
    would be much appreciated.

  comment_content: '@Larry: That layout is a little to big to go through in a comment
    like this but I can tell you the general idea: You build up a grid pretty much
    in the same way as with tables. The difference is that the grids are a lot more
    flexible than their table counterparts. After that you start to aply background-images
    to the different blocks. That allows you do do things like gradients, shadows
    and those things. CSS allows you to decide in what direction to repeat images,
    so you don''t need another block to have something in the right corner of another.\n\nHope
    that gives you some ideas.'

  comment_content: Larry, I'm totally with you there, and I'm not a designer, just
    a web developer / programmer.\n\nI detest the decision to deny us the full usefulness
    of tables. Row height has been rendered useless, and this was a staple of many
    wonderful layouts. There was *no* real disadvantage, in the *real world*, to using
    tables.\n\nAs for using FLOATS for layout, that is *plagued* with problems. Try
    using a "clear:both" in any part of your body content, or menu content, and your
    template is destroyed. That's because "clear" clears *all floats on the page*
    not just the last one encountered.\n\nUsing floats for templates is nicely conformist,
    but highly impractical unless you are very careful with page content so it doesn't
    break the layout. That makes it a pain for CMS applications for a start.\n\nThe
    W3C is living in lala land when it comes to the needs of both designers and web
    app coders. If they just hadn't deprecated table row height it wouldn't be so
    bad. The fact they're now formalising the "border-box" option in CSS3 means many,
    many people have complained! IE did have a valid position, no matter what the
    purists say.\n\n/rant

  comment_content: As an example of my above statement, of "clear" breaking floated
    layouts, just do this:\n\nIn the example given on this page, "3 columns using
    float-margin", add the following code to the "content2" block (replace square
    brackets of course):\n\n[div style="float:left"]float this left[/div]\n[div style="clear:both"][/div]\n[div]template
    is now broken[/div]\n\nWhen you add the above code, the "broken" words are placed
    below the level of the "content1" block. It is no longer flowing directly under
    the content2 text.\n\nThis is a problem where the "clear" appears in a column
    which is not as tall as one of the others. The text suddenly jumps to the lowest
    position on the page.\n\nTherefore, using floats for layouts is ONLY practical
    if you NEVER need to use "clear:both" in your content.

  comment_content: '@David: If you use the float-float method, you will see that the
    issue with clear: both does not exist there.\n\nIf you want to use float-margin,
    you can still use clearfix to clear your content. So the templates are all fine,
    and we need no tables for layout.'

  comment_content: These are very handy bits of code to get a css layout started.
    I've had this page bookmarked for quite some time and I refer back to it often
    when I'm working on page layouts.\nJust wanted to say thanks!

  comment_content: By examining both the methods of layouts, I feel like going for
    the float-float method though both have there pros. The float-float method offers
    more clarity and looks more better to the eye though I am in complete agreement
    with the view that you can work with float-margin method more easily as the second
    column expands automatically.

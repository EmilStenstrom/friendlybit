    me posting a few articles about my work here. I’ve found far too few blog posts

  comment_content: Hey man.\n\nI feel that Sharepoint is more directed to Intranet,
    but recently I saw a good deal of sites using Sharepoin.\n\nYa Sharepoint customization
    can be messy and annoying, but I feel it is really powerful.\n\nTry using Sharepoint
    Designer.

  comment_content: I'm glad to see some examples from people about the MOSS shortfalls
    rather than just general bashing. My only comment is on the page size; when I
    check the properties on our OOTB sites they appear pretty small, so maybe I'm
    missing something....

  comment_content: '@Hasan: Sharepoint Designer (aka a upgrade of Frontpage), does
    not help with any of the issues I bring forward here. \n\n@Jesper Rønn-Jensen:
    Thanks Jesper, I''ll sure keep writing about Sharepoint. \n\nPretty urls are "semi-possible".
    Each url point to one aspx-page (no MVC here). Each site you create turns into
    one directory, and each site has a default aspx-page it redirects to. So you can
    build urls like example.com/ store/electronics/ sweden.aspx, where "store" is
    a Sharepoint site, "electronics" a subsite, and "sweden.aspx" is a page in the
    electronics site.\n\n@Ross: Thanks, I thought this kind a article, with real arguments,
    was missing too. With page size I means both HTML, and core.css and core.js. You
    can get the full site by using Firebug, clicking the "Net" tab, and reloading.
    Is it still small?'

  comment_content: Thanks for the insight in MOSS. \n\nI would like to say that Intranets
    should also be accessible, not only public websites. There is of course people
    with accessibility problems using Intranets as there is people using public websites.\n\nBrowser
    support is also important, you never know when the IT department decides to switch
    and instead of using IE start using OP or FF. That happened on IBM when they tried
    to go from IE to FF. Because so many Intranet applications where built for IE
    they could not make a big shift.

  comment_content: Thank's for a good article! Some months ago we built a public Sharepoint
    web site for a Swedish authority that had special demands on accessability (Verva's
    guidelines). We also performed a usability test with visually handicapped persons.
    We experienced that especially the forms were a big issue since they are using
    a lot of JS. Web forms can otherwise, with high accessability, be very helpful
    for handicapped persons, but not with MOSS. \n\nIf you decide to use MOSS, at
    least avoid forms! You will get a lot of problems with adapting them.

  comment_content: 'Very informative article. And, Yes - Everything you wrote is true.
    \n\nThough, you can <em>skin</em> the admin interface with some branding elements
    and colors.\n\nCSS Specificity works flawlessly provided one uses <code>body id
    =""</code>. Specificity also allows one to overwrite in-line styles (of which
    MOSS has an incredible amount) by using !important.\n\nAs to your comment about
    SharePoint lack of blogs with detailed help: you can find all sorts of programming
    help but nearly all of the articles are written by persons that do not seem to
    have heard about Web Standards. (Heather Solomon being the exception.) And, most
    of the fixes are ASP.NET 2 complicated.\n\nFrom the amount of new articles on
    Web Standards sites (like yours), it seems that MOSS instead of IE6/7/8 has become
    the new poster child for Web Standards education.'

  comment_content: Hi - some of your points are valid, but I would say your conclusions
    are flawed. I think you need to have faith and work through the examples of how
    to get "better" html output from SharePoint. For *public facing websites*, you
    don't really need the majority of SharePoint controls, and you can quite easily
    remove core.js and core.css from your page via an HTTP handler for anonymous users
    (this isn't officially supported, but since it is something than can easily be
    switched back off, you can quickly get back to a supported state). \n\nNot going
    to go through your points one by one, but a few things occured to me:\n\n1) VPC
    size. I don't know what you've been doing to your images, but my dev vpcs are
    all about 8GB in size. I'd look at optimising your vpc builds...\n\n2) Accessibility.
    This is a known issue, which the Accessibility Kit for SharePoint is fixing in
    part. For public facing webs, you have more flexibility, but the editing functionality
    is always going to be a problem from an accessibility point of view (which is
    not limited to MOSS, btw).\n\n3) Control adapters can help with OOTB controls
    such as the menu / nav controls. See the ASP.NET CSS Control Adapters for more
    info.\n\n4) You can brand SP sites, see for example <a href="http://www.hedkandi.com"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.hedkandi.com</a> for a more "design" focused example.\n\n5)
    Branding blogs and application pages - see the "Community Kit for SharePoint"
    and "SuperBranding", both on CodePlex.com for examples of how to do this easily.

  comment_content: '@Ben Robb: Isn''t the purpose of a system like Sharepoint to help
    you? Sure, you can go through all the hassle you describe above just to get a
    decent site running, but picking <strong>another tool</strong> is a much more
    effective way of doing the same thing. Really, you can''t really think Sharepoint
    is a good way of developing websites?\n\n1) No matter what size you have, it''s
    still half the RAM and processing power. No other CMS requires that. Period.\n\n2)
    That it''s known and partly patched in a 3rd party addon does <strong>not</strong>
    make it OK. MOSS adds accessibility problems that most other tools does not have.\n\n3)
    Yes, you can hack around the controls that are there to save you time.\n\n4) Yes,
    I know all about hedkandi, it''s just as customized as the site I''m building.
    That you can add pretty images and custom CSS does not make it a good CMS (or
    other) tool. You can do that with any tool out there, anything else would be insane.
    MOSS requires you to hack more than any other one I''ve used.\n\n5) Why do you
    need to download additional unsupported components to change things like blogs?
    Really, is that reasonable?'

  comment_content: Emil,\nI've read through a few of your MOSS/WSS postings. With
    all due respect, I don't think you quite understand what SharePoint is. Calling
    SharePoint a CMS system is like calling Exchange (or Domino, if you prefer something
    non-MS) an SMTP server.\nI have to agree with Ben on most of his remarks.\nIn
    additon, only a compiled .Net control will have a combination of logic and presentation,
    and only then, if the developer of the control made it that way.\n.Net itself
    emphasises the seperation of logic and presentation. If what you're getting out
    of the box doesn't suit you, write your own or look on codeplex or any of the
    other million developer sites (and they're not "unsupported", as you state).\nBottom
    line is, building elaborate internet facing sites based on WSS or MOSS only makes
    sense if you intend to also leverage the underlying framework for functionality
    (authentication systems, integration with AD/CRM/Exchange/etc, collaboration functionality,
    personalization etc etc etc). \nOtherwise, that would be like (to use my example
    from above) installing an Exchange Server as a simple mail relay and - I agree
    with you there - way too much work.

  comment_content: '@Marcus: So what should I call it? "Portal" or "platform" is far
    to ambiguous to make sense to people... and the fact is, most people use it as
    a CMS of some kind.\n\nAbout .NET controls. The problem is that virtually <strong>all</strong>
    controls that come with Sharepoint are built with a mixed frontend and backend.
    You can build any controls you want (except if you want webparts, you have to
    mix them then), but we''re not talking about just any system now, we''re talking
    about Sharepoint.\n\nAbout codeplex: Sure, you can download stuff from there and
    use them instead, but wasn''t the reason you paid immense amounts of money for
    MOSS to not have to download stuff? The <strong>default Sharepoint</strong> stuff
    needs to be much more customizable.\n\nI''ve working in a project where we''re
    pushed MOSS to the limits, making sure the customer are free to use everything
    that comes out of the box (all the things you mention). The problem is that the
    defaults are of such bad quality, that we often have to patch or hack them to
    make them usable. Or replace them fully by something from codeplex. That''s not
    a good way to build stuff.'

  comment_content: Emil, you are so true about all the SharePoint shortcomings. I've
    been developing SharePoint based solutions for over a year, and I must say that
    customizing it is a real mess.\n\nI like SharePoint for its power of integration,
    but every time a client asks me about a CMS/intranet portal, I advise him NOT
    to use SharePoint, because of the painful development process (especially with
    its high price tag!).

  comment_content: This reminds me of old school iframes, but using css makes it more
    accessible and more search engine friendly.

  comment_content: '@Mac: I just tested it again, for me, it works fine of chrome
    on the mac.\n\n@Johan: I deliberately did not add a fix for IE6 to keep the code
    to a minimum. IE6 is dying soon anyways.\n\n@Gin: Same here, such a shame. Doesn''t
    Safari for iPhone support position: fixed?\n\nTo all: Even though it doesn''t
    work everywhere, it falls back nicely everywhere I''ve tried, including Safari
    for iPhone. So you should be fine using it anyway.'

  comment_content: 'Why use <code>!important</code> hack, when IE will also apply
    <code>_background: red</code> declaration. True the CSS won''t validate, but since
    websites are for users, not for validators, this shouldn''t matter that much.'

  comment_content: Thanks for the css code on this.\nI just converted a page using
    frames to this style.\n\nThe page works fine .....But, when I convert it to an
    external style sheet it works fine on the server. But it doesn't work when I run
    it merely on the local computer.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nThe content page
    scrolls over the top of the header.\n\nHere's the page:\nhttp://www.testfamilygenealogy.com/Narratives/Early/fryburg.html\n\nAny
    idea how to fix it?\n\nThanks

  comment_content: Interesting, but I will not use it as IE6 has not completely disappeared
    ... The demos make one think of the 90s with flashy colors and frames, it is a
    form of nostalgia? :)

  comment_content: Emil -\nThanks for the articles and the important descriptions
    of dealing with IE 6.\n\nHowever, this is generally pretty basic stuff. How about
    something like a full length header with a fixed navigation on the left and two
    vertical frames on the right, with a fixed header and footer on the top "frame"
    with a scrolling frame in the middle, and each "frame" adjustable - so that the
    Navigation will slide in or out of site and the top or bottom "frame" of the right
    main "frame" can be expanded/contracted to fit the entire main "frame".\n\nThis
    is what I have together, with a scrolling grid in the top right frame, but I can't
    seem to keep the grid within bounds. It wants to run off the side of the screen
    on the right the same distance of the left navigation area.\n\nTop banner is fixed,
    Navigation is fixed, right main "frame" is fixed. I have tried everything in the
    way of positioning on the grid area (upper right), which needs to have overflow
    set to "auto". I was hoping to find an example on the Web, but no luck.

  comment_content: The information shared on IE6 is very useful and worth knowing.
    Its good  that the users won't be able to see the broken site. The fixed CSS templates
    would prove a breakthrough indeed.

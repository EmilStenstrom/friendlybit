  comment_content: Some examples from W3C on how to write <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere"
    title=")" rel="nofollow">link text</a>.\n\n\nBtw, one thing I thought about when
    reading this is, how should one handle "<a href="javascript:history.go(-1);" rel="nofollow">go
    back</a>" or "<a href="javascript:window.location.reload();" rel="nofollow">try
    again</a>" links.\n\n\nIn some way it feels right to write it like that, but it
    also feels like there should be some better way.\n\nWithout redirect I mean.

  comment_content: I agree with your point fully, but aren't there certain situations
    where it becomes awkward not to use the click here?  For example, "To read the
    full report, <a>click here</a>"  What would you replace it with?\n"Read the <a>full
    report</a>" sounds a little demanding.\n"Here you can read the <a>full report</a>"
    - Is this much better than click here?\nMaybe, "The <a>full report</a> is available
    for download."\n\nThose all sound more awkward than click here.  What would you
    suggest?

  comment_content: 'A subject near and dear to my heart. Like Caroline (comment #8),
    I believe the source of poorly labeled links is often copy supplied by the client.
    Clients just love the term ''click here'', presumably because they don''t realise
    how meaningless it is, both to readers and to search engines. I usually go through
    my clients'' text and change it so the links integrate more meaningfully into
    the flow of the copy.'

  comment_author: Do Not Say Click Here on iface thoughts
  comment_author_url: http://ifacethoughts.net/2006/11/29/do-not-say-click-here/
  comment_content: '[...] Do not make it that obvious! Emil Stenström discusses this
    and advises that the link text should inform the reader about the content it links
    to. It should be something that the reader can use to decide whether to click
    on the link or not. This seems pretty logical and obvious once told. But many
    are guilty, including yours truly (I actually changed text on pages before I wrote
    this!), of being too lazy to come up with the right text. Roger Johansson gives
    some more examples. Even W3C has this down as one of the quality assurance tips.
    Click here will be really useless when there will be no clicks! Use contextual
    and informative link text! [...]'

  comment_content: Totally agree.  In fact "click here" used as link text will fail
    accessibility validators like cynthia says.  Some developers are getting to understand
    this so have improved an use better link text like "read more on <strong><em>subject</em></strong>"  or
    "find out about <strong><em>subject</em></strong> here"  but still a correct link
    text is neeeded for accessibility and better still extra information about the
    link in the title attribute.\n\nStill I think the "click here" link is going to
    be around for a while still

    to market better than Emil, but they do not know how best to market.  A call to

    cite="http://www.lyrishq.com/content/view/88/">As a command, “click here” is beautiful
    in its simplicity, but it falls far short as a call to action – the trigger to
    launch the customer on the complicated path to conversion – because it doesn’t

  comment_content: Interesting discussion here.\n\nI have myself done quite a lot
    of A/B-testing with call to actions in link text (both images and in written language).\n\nFrom
    my experience, "Click here" is an extremely strong call to action that really
    drives clicks like nothing else.\n\nOf course you need to use it in combination
    with some other text like "to read the full entry - click here!" to imply what
    is hidden behind the jump though.\n\nThe discussion of trust and how fooling your
    visitors into visiting pages that they really wasn't that interested in is very
    relevant. "Trust" is however a very abstract word and very, very hard to measure
    why the real consequences of it can only be guessed at.\n\nMy favorite example
    is Sweden's largest online newspaper Aftonbladet.se that constantly fools its
    readers with bogus headlines that don't match the article's content. Still, it
    is Sweden's largest online newspaper. Something worth thinking about :)

  comment_content: '@Niklas Olsson: Very interesting to hear that "Click here" performs
    so well in tests. Do I understand you correctly when you say that "read the full
    entry" performs worse than "To read the full entry - click here"? If that''s the
    case, it''s seems that the combination of both a descriptive text, and the words
    "click here" performs best? It might be just my web experience, but to me, the
    color and underlining of links is what screams "click here".\n\nAbout trust and
    measuring: Maybe you could setup two pages, one with a click here-link to the
    second page, and another with some text. Then measure the time spent on the second
    page. If what you said about is correct, I would suspect that more people click
    through when you include "click here", but they stay on the second page for a
    shorter period of time. Even though they clicked, they are not as sure why, and
    are more likely to click the back button when there. That''s my guess anyway,
    and my arguments for still staying away from "click here" text.\n\nThe Aftonbladet
    (or any other big site) argument is a misleading one. It didn''t get big because
    of tricking people to click links they don''t want, do they? They got big because
    of other reasons, and are tricking people to get more ad impressions. A very different
    issue altogether!\n\nThanks for your comment!'

  comment_content: The company I work for also uses SharePoint and I feel your pain.
    SharePoint is hot and customers want it and are willing to pay for it because
    it's a Microsoft product backed up by their huge marketing machine.\nI've made
    a promise to myself that if MS does not make SP easy to program to in it's next
    version I am abondoning it. I'm a developer and the developing experiene is is
    bad. I have to install SharePoint on my development machine to get anything done.
    \nI find m find myself programming on the server machine many times... this is
    simply not right. \nMS technology has a lot going for it but the next iteration
    of the product has to be focused on standard oriented designers and developers.\nAtm
    I see all of these problems as a challenge to solven, using DDD for example, (I'm
    a moderate optimist) but I also see that php/open source friends are cranking
    out beautful solutions with CMS systems like Drupal &amp; co.\nMS, do the right
    think please! Developers, developers, developers?

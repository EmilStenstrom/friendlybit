  comment_content: Finally, a nice way to fix all the padding/margin issues, while
    at the same time keeping the buttons functioning as buttons. Thanks!

  comment_content: Hi Emil, my name is Jose Cabana.\nI’m a graphic designer from Venezuela,
    a tropical country in South America.\nFirst of all, let me thank you and congratulate
    you for your excellent blog.\nI’ve found it recently, and I must say that it has
    been very useful to me.\nYou’ve helped me to clarify some key concepts about standards
    development.\nIn my new weblog (in Spanish) I’m trying to write about these topics
    and I\nwonder if it would be ok to translate some parts of your articles into
    Spanish.\nOf course, I’d let people know that you are the original writer.\nI
    hope this doesn’t bother you in any way, but, if so, please, let me know.\nI’ll
    look forward for your answer.

  comment_content: I'm glad that you agree. \nOf course, a link to your site will
    be shown as well as your credits.\nThere is less information about web standards
    in Spanish than in English. For that reason I think that a translation of your
    articles would be very useful.\nI mistyped my URL in my first comment, now it's
    fine so that you can check the future posts.\nThanks a lot!

  comment_content: Another option that's becoming popular in light of IE 7 coming
    out soon is conditional comments.  If something doesn't work in IE, you can create
    a separate stylesheet and put the reference to it within conditional comments.  This
    allows you to avoid CSS hacks altogether, and lets you apply stylesheets only
    to certain versions of IE.

  comment_content: Unfortunately, the conditional comments does not work with the
    standalone versions of Internet Explorer; it does not matter for people in general
    but it could be a problem for a web developer. A "good" solution could be to use
    the <a href="http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/ie55winbandpass.html" title="IE5.5/Windows
    Band Pass Filter" rel="nofollow">IE5.5/Windows Band Pass Filter</a> (or it's equivalent
    for IE5.0).

  comment_content: 'I kind of disagree on your advice when it comes to using XHTML
    transitional. I find using XHTML strict limits you in a lot of ways: e.g. pages
    won''t validate that use a taget="_blank" which I sometimnes find very useful

    XHTML 1.0 transitional usually gives you all the benefits you are referring to.
    What where you referring to when you said, that the validation information you
    get for transitional is not as useful?'

  comment_content: 'Hello, Emil. Look at this, please (some info about * selector):\n\n«The
    other thing is the use of the "star-selector," or * { } in CSS. The star selector
    selects every single element, which produces an overkill of style-nullifying.
    Sander pointed out that Mozilla (for one) has a great deal of default styling
    on form controls, which the star selector nullifies when applying margin:0 and
    padding:0 to it. As a result, buttons don''t behave like buttons anymore, and
    so forth. I never really noticed that, which only goes to show that I''m no longer
    used to buttons behaving like buttons. I did some research in this, and as it
    turned out, most of all the weblogs I frequently comment on have this same problem:
    buttons not behaving like buttons. In most cases, it was indeed the star selector
    being the culprit.»\n\nCitation from http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2005/07/26/starting-css-revisited\n\nMaksim

    This article goes over the importants of keeping the browser out of the legacy
    quirks mode and using simple CSS rules to initialize compliant browsers into a
    common style. For example, you may have noticed on certain sites that Opera renders
    an unordered list way to the left of the position Mozilla Firefox and IE render

  comment_content: 'Michael: you can use CSS fixed positioning to make menu and header
    etc. stick while the rest scrolls. There''s an IE behaviours file that used JavaScript
    to make IE (which doesn''t do fixed positioning) errr.. behave. Eric Meyer''s
    two ''on CSS'' books have the link... Emil: I think this is what Micheal intended,
    rather than the scripting you''ve mentioned. BTW, the quick uptake of PHP often
    ends up mixing logic and presentation, which is what we''re trying to avoid with
    markup and presentation in CSS and valid (X)HTML, and there also are also ways
    of dynamically showing and hiding content with CSS. Ruby on Rails (RoRis probably
    the way to go if you want to be more dynamic, but that''s more of a programmer''s
    art and a whole step sideways from CSS/(X)HTML still, to do a good job with RoR,
    valid CSS and (X)HTML skills are still a must. PS I tend to ''flatten padding
    and margins with *{} but find it wierdly closes up line spacing (which only shows
    up in multiline headings) in IE - easy to fix, but anyone know why?'

    is there a way to configure IE6 to view certain sites properly without having
    to upgrade to IE7? I viewed a site (torrentz.com) in IE6, and it looks like it
    has no CSS elements at all. Thanks.

  comment_content: Hi Emil\nI have a problem with my site. It appears that the site
    requires a firefox browser but when i use it with explorer some of the pages don't
    align properly. Could you give me some suggestions. Hell i'll even allow you to
    adjust the code for me, if thats what it takes. I know your the best from what
    ive read. Please email me as well. Its seems that the song page and the idiom
    pages have the biggest problem. Funny thing is, that i went to my friends house
    and had them download the firefox browser and guess what the same browser the
    firefox browser had an alignment problem. Is the firefox browser shit or what?

  comment_content: One reason that browsers have quirks mode is because that older
    (and current) versions of browsers are buggy (in particular IE6).   We had to
    work around those bugs when developing pages.  It's not really fair to say that
    they exist just because web developers don't know what they are doing.

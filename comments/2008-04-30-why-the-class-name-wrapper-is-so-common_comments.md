  comment_content: This points to another benefit of HTML5, since common class names
    will become element names (footer, aside, etc), making it a little easier on CMS
    makers &amp; web developers who use them.

  comment_content: If the person creating the design of a site doesn't know anything
    about the content, I think xe should ask someone.\n\nDesign is about communication,
    and I think the person doing the design should know what kind of information it
    will be used to communicate.

  comment_content: I think the reason is much simpler than that. Fixed-width layouts
    often need a div to wrap around all the content, wrapper seems like a good name
    for it.\n\nAs for semantics not taking a  hold in the CMS world, that's a whole
    different problem. The blame lies with CMS vendors, the WYSIWYG editors they use,
    and the people who implement the products. There's a lot of education that still
    needs to happen.

  comment_content: I think CMS's usually fail at producing quality output because
    by their nature, CMS's are intended to have low-quality input from untrained users.\n\nStill,
    I don't understand why CMS's have such horrible CSS support. Maybe it's just in
    the K12 education CMS's I've worked with.

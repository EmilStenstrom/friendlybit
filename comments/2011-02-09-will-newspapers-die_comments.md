  comment_content: The interesting effect of all this will come in about 5-10 years,
    when people born in the 80's will reach boss and CEO positions in the big media
    corps.\n\nMost of these people will by then never have subscribed to a printed
    newspaper.\n\nAnd according to stats (lies, damn lies, stats) even less of the
    people born in the 90' or 00' will have done so.\n\nFuture bosses and CEO's will
    therefore make things change. A lot, I guess.

  comment_content: I don't know the newspapers. I think they're classic and classics
    never die. But I'm sure that magazines' print versions will die in someday. But
    it doesn't mean the death of magazines. iPad and other tablet devices will change
    a lot of things. As you see they've allready started to change.

  comment_content: If you check India's newspapers industry you will really shock
    that How big is this...and in how many different language papers publish in India...its
    not  tolerable for us to miss our newspaper for single day...in New delhi in whole
    year only on 2 days paper dont print and those 2 days without newspaper is lyk
    hell.\n\nipad and latest technology are coming but still people really need to
    read the print version...they like to carry the newspaper with them to keep the
    cutting with them...\n\nI dont think so its easy for Newspaper Industry to vanish...

  comment_content: I think hard print newspapers will eventually die because you already
    have online publication of the same thing and some people already find it easier
    to subscribe instead of stopping at the garage everyday to get the same news stories
    available online

  comment_content: Newspapers in small towns have the chance today to not make the
    same mistakes as their urban counterparts. The key is hyper-local content. This
    is what is important to those living in small towns. World news is free, but local
    news is valuable. Local business advertising, combined with local news and community
    content is the key to newspapers transitioning to a digital world.

  comment_content: Not only do I think newspapers will die a slow and painful death,
    I think email will die as well. Anyone I know that is under 20 never emails me,
    it's always text. I realize email is important for business right now but not
    so sure about in the future. Nothing I hate more than sifting through tons of
    emails every morning, rinse, repeat.

  comment_content: Like you said, if newspapers start to be online only, their profits
    would be much lower.  It would also allow small newspapers to compete easily because
    their overhead would be decreased.

  comment_content: We are in the world of information and newspapers are a means through
    which people get informed. Therefore, newspaper can only die when people no longer
    look for information, but as long as we want an informed society, newspapers will
    thrive.

  comment_content: IE has always supported transparency on png-8 and it makes no difference
    if is installed as a standalone version or not.\n\nI use a variation of bgsleight
    to manage png-24 , it seems to work with IE standalone, and has the advantage
    of supporting background-repeat.

  comment_content: I decided to use the Virtual PC Console instead of a standalone
    IE6, there is even a new updated version of VPC out now. And the latest Win XP
    SP2 iso is legit until aug 07. Works like a charm. Try it out!

  comment_content: Ah, ok, tastes vary, the PNG testing was the only reason I got
    VPC in the first place and it's only 2 mousklicks if you have a saved state :)
    I am currently looking into the differences between bgsleight.js, lepngfix.htc
    and Michael Lovitt's opacity script found at <a href="http://alistapart.com/stories/pngopacity/"

  comment_content: Hi Emil,\n\nI was just struggling with  transparent PNGs and IE6
    stand alone last night. A wasted hour later, I came to the same conclusion as
    you!  I tried the iepngfix.htc and I believe that also did not work in the IE6
    standalone, though I may be wrong.  In the end, I ended up dragging out an old
    laptop to use IE6 to solve the problem.  Good article!

  comment_content: Emil, I love that you love Fireworks. You should do a write up
    on FW's advantages over the other image editors in the market today. No one seems
    to believe me when I praise its powerful capabilities.

  comment_content: '@Jonas Hallgren: What about doing a writeup on the differences
    between them yourself? I can publish it here if you want?\n\n@Adam Rissner: Yeah,
    another computer is always an option, it''s just that you can''t have one computer

  comment_content: How familiar this problem. I use PNG in my website and really like
    the effects. But testing in IE6 gave the problems you describe in this subject.
    Since fixes are not always valid, I made a separate CSS file for IE 5.5 till IE
    6.0 without the PNG effects.\n\nI hope IE 6 (in March 2007 still 38,7% of all
    used browsers) will update IE 7 (in March 2007 18% of all browsers) very soon
    or use another kind browser like Firefox (in March 2007 31,8% of all used browsers).\n\nSource

  comment_content: I believe that IE6 standalone, on the same PC as IE7, thinks that
    it is IE7 as far as conditional comments are concerned. So conditional comments
    targetting IE6 are ignored.

  comment_content: '@Stu: Hi Stu, nice to see some celebrities here on my little blog
    :)\n\nThe IE6 Standalone version I''m using (linked to in the first paragraph)
    has the conditional comments problem solved. I''ve confirmed that it works. \n\nThe
    only two things that annoy me about IE6 standalone right now is the problem above
    and that you don''t get any print previews from it. Other than that it''s a great
    tool.'

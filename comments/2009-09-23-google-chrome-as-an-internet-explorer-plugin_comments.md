  comment_content: The big challenge still remains of course; to make users of IE
    install the plugin. I suppose using services like Wave to actively force them
    to do it is one way, but I wonder what they plan to do about all the corporate
    users who don't have admin access to their workstations.

    very useful for us running Firefox in a corporate environment that only supports
    IE.

    allows you to run Chrome inside IE. That''s pretty new, because suddenly we can
    ignore their poor standards support.'

  comment_content: '@Linus G Theil, Carl-Emil Lagerstedt: Yeah, I use that one myself.
    This is different though, since it doesn''t require Chrome to be installed separately.
    The plugin is all you need.'

  comment_content: Nice to hear that but i think that only a small procent of users
    will install and use this plugin.\n\nAnyway, let us wait for the Microsoft giant
    reply.

  comment_content: Its weird that they are trying to push a plug-in and emulate the
    different browsers.  Wouldn't it be easier to support IE?

  comment_content: I'm sorry if you have taken this the wrong way, but I never meant
    to support old software.  IE is still a popular internet browser.  I was just
    surprised that they weren't going to support any version of it.

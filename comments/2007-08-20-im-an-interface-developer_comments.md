  comment_content: Haha... a good read and probably not too far from a suitable title.
    I love the way you managed to write these caricatures  leaving no room for any
    prejudges to shine through what so ever ;-)

    read about what a <a href="http://shelter.nu/art-wuid-001.html" rel="nofollow">WUID</a>
    is.'

  comment_content: Well said.  I appreciate the creation of the "interface developer"
    and differentiation between it and the other two positions.

  comment_content: That was a very cute article. I'm gonna have to go and re-tag my
    business cards with 'wuid' instead of designer. I've always felt 'designer' was
    a bit too artistic for me anyway.

  comment_content: '@Nicole: Yeah, isn''t it? Personally I''m not that fond of abbreviations
    like WUID, so I think I''ll keep saying just "interface developer". Thanks for
    the comment'

  comment_content: Yes, very nice and politically correct post. :-)\n\nMe myself,
    I've always regarded myself as an Interface Developer, filling in the gap (or
    at least giving them someone mutual to hate, instead of each other...).

  comment_content: You're either on LSD or you're full of crap. If you like your job,
    fine, but don't bash other people. I'm an "interface developer" too, but i don't
    say/write crap like that about programmers or artists.\nGeez, you're so narrow
    minded.

  comment_content: Errr....I could not DISAGREE more. "Real" web developers are web
    designers and vice versa. They work seamlessly between each craft, writing rules
    in CSS that turn into beautiful styles, coding lightweight Javascript that translates
    into pretty transitions, and floating layouts that are pleasing to the eye. How
    do you think Johansson, Zeldman, Meyer, Budd, and Moll do it? Not like you've
    described.\n\nI'm sorry you've had such a pathetic experience in the web industry,
    but that's not how MY experience has been at all.

  comment_content: I couldn't help but disagree Emil. There really is no title for
    seperation if you can all.  That said, designers should know basic HTML and usability
    and some basic web standards as well as some basic SEO. If they don't then the
    SEO team should know some design and usability to know where the designer is going
    and make some decisions. Same for the programmer, a good programmer is creative.
    Separating titles based on assumption and not real skills is bad :(

  comment_content: Good article. I like the idea of the title of "Interface Developer"
    - or better yet "Web Interface Developer."

  comment_content: Most companies I've seen, have the developer in the I.T. department
    and designer in the marketing department.  With the designer issuing instructions
    to the developer on how the user interface should work.

  comment_content: I wonder if you needed to tell this whole story just to explain
    what you do or whether you are trying to tell web crawlers that this is a good
    page with good content, rank it well ! Nice work anyway..

  comment_content: '@Smarmy: I bet each one of them have a designer that is responsible
    for the design and look''n''feel contraints. These poor bastards also work closest
    to the client to map the needs and wishes for the product.\n\nI also think they
    have people responsible for backend, like EPiServer or Polopoly, which don''t
    have the skills or the time to write HTML good enugh.\n\nI don''t know your experience,
    but I have worked in projects exactly like Emil describes in his post.'

  comment_content: Nice article. Thanks! The part about the clothes is awesome. :-)\nAnd
    indeed there is a translation need between programmers and designers. Of course
    being heavily depending on personality and experience as well. And yes, there
    are  those allrounders who just seem have it all. But in general one might experience
    (like myself) that tech and design talk can be a very painful communication experience.

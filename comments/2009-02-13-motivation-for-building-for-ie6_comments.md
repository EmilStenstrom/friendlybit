  comment_content: I think you're wrong.\n\nI'm a web developer, and a heavy web application
    user. But there is still only one application in my whole arsenal that would make
    me switch browser, and that is my bank. If any other website would ask me to switch,
    I would just leave - just as I did with facebook a couple of days ago when they
    wouldn't let me login with Chrome.\n\nIt is not the web developers responsibility
    to get people to update their browsers. It is the web developers responsibility
    to make their applications usable for the majority of users out there. If you
    would tell me not to come to your party with the cloths I'm wearing I would just
    not come to your party, since I like my cloths.\n\nHave you considered why users
    still use IE6? It is not because it is a superiour browser. I would say it is
    because they're sitting on bad ass old hardware. Upgrading their browser would
    considerably slow down their already dead slow computers. And who would pay money
    for new hardware just to browse your site?\n\nI can't believe that users are staying
    with IE6 out of ignorance. I think it is mainly a choice. Could be a choice of
    the user, or the company that they work on, but I personally find it hard to keep
    IE6 on a newly installed Windows XP if I don't shut down windows updates all together
    (which also can be tricky).\n\nI use whatever browser I want and it is your job
    to make it work. If I would use IE8 you could present me with an all jQueryish
    experience, but I would still want to access all the information even if I'd prefer
    using Lynx.

  comment_content: Do you practice this at Valtech as well? When you build an intranet
    for a company where the employees does not have control over which browser is
    installed? Or are those cases so different...\n\nIt's one thing to experiment
    on a personal blog. It is something different to ask the project manager at your
    clients company to explain to his clients marketing manager why things look strange
    in her browser and why she needs to upgrade it...

  comment_content: '@Mikael Lundin. I see it like this: most intranets on the large
    computer farms of big coorporations use to have policys about hardware, usually
    a couple of years (3-5). Counting on that, the eldest thin clients counts back
    to 2004/2005. When it comes to private users, these tend to upgrade their hardware
    in a 3-4 year cycle (in Sweden some stick to "hem-pc", a three-year old leasing
    program for your non-swedes information). That in count, the eldest home pc:s
    are from 2005/2006.\n\nBoth these groups are the two top reasons why IE6 still
    lives. At least one of them can be targeted by Emils proposal. The other one will
    do an upgrade eventually, probably installing Vista or Win 7 with IE7 or IE8.\n\nI
    believe you cannot do harm by tipping about newer versions. It isn''t the same
    thing as locking people out.\n\nI have updated my own (swedish) website now.'

  comment_content: '@Mikael Lundin: In most cases I''ve seen IE6 installed it''s been
    with people that have no idea what a browser is. And I''m willing to bet that''s
    95%. Hardware is not an issue here, IE7 uses less resources, and is faster on
    slow hardware.\n\nAlso, this is about building to standards, instead of IE6. There''s
    a big difference between IE6 and Chrome there, and that''s standards. I thought
    we all agreed that those where a good thing?\n\nAlso, Lynx does follow standards.
    IE6 does not, that''s why it''s such a pain to develop for, while Lynx is not.'

  comment_content: '@Marcus Andersson: This blog is my own, not Valtech''s. That said,
    I do try to practice this at work too. I''ve recently been a driving force for
    getting a major company to upgrade all their browsers to IE7, for their new intranet.
    I''ve heard <a href="http://robertnyman.com" rel="nofollow">Robert</a>, my colleague,
    argue himself to one upgrade too. \n\nNow. If an upgrade isn''t possible, then
    we can''t skip IE6, that isn''t reasonable. But I''m never going to let that pass
    easily, I''m going to research why, and I''m going to spend time of my own to
    upgrade if that''s what''s needed. I''m never just saying "Oh gosh", and then
    let it go again.\n\nWe need to remember that we work in a big ecosystem, and as
    web developers have possibilities to change that are bigger than we first think.\n\nStill,
    if you don''t agree with me, at least consider to add the "upgrade bar" to your
    sites. You can still waste as much time to build for IE6, just tell people to
    upgrade too.'

  comment_content: Emil, my main issue was that you seemed to think that special cases
    did not apply and then pointed to you blog as an example. I just wanted to point
    out that your own blog is in fact a special case. Normally you have a lot of people
    that are going to react if you suddenly throw up error boxes that nobody specified.\n\nOn
    the other hand I think it is great that you are able to influence browser usage
    for clients. But those decisions tend to take some time and they are usually not
    up to web developers to make.\n\nBack on topic...\nI can't help but think that
    it is a little bit rude to tell people what they should have installed om their
    computer. Maybe as a notice on why some parts of the site might look strange,
    combined with a helpful explanation of what they could do about it if they care
    enough.\n\nOn personal projects I usually don't take ie6 into consideration. I
    might go back after the release to tack on Dean Edwards ie7 or a png-fix. Most
    things tend to work ok without special adjustments though.\n\nAt work on the other
    hand, testing for ie6 is mandatory. Most clients use it, they have to use it and
    there really are no possibilities to change that. We work with progressive enhancement
    as much as we can, but even that is a stretch as clients still get very worried
    when things look different in different browsers.\n\nHmm, that was one big special
    case...

  comment_content: Swedish reply sorry\n\nJag är inte userinterfacedesigner i grunden,
    utan entreprenör, mitt fokus är inte i grunden att skapa en bra upplevelse för
    alla användare, utan skapa ekonomiska resultat. Dessa två principer brukar för
    det mesta gå hand i hand, och det är därför jag läser den här bloggen. Lite förvånad
    är jag, men när jag läste det här inlägget, insåg ett bra exempel på att så inte
    nödvändigtvis är fallet.\n\nJag har såklart länge känt till problematiken med
    IE6 och att det kostar mycket tid och pengar för att få det att fungera. Att ha
    en icke fungerande site i IE6, skrämmer i nuläget bort en ganska ansenlig andel
    av potentiella kunder/användare, varför jag har fokuserat på att se till att de
    siter jag utvecklar fungerar även i IE6. Men nu insåg jag just, att den tiden,
    (30-50% av UI-utvecklarnas tid) kanske kan spenderas bättre. Om den tiden istället
    kan läggas på att skapa andra värden, som bättre kommunikation med befintliga
    besökare eller att driva mer trafik till sidan, kan det äta upp kakan IE6 användare.\n\nDet
    absolut viktigaste med den här tanken, är att fokusera på andra saker än IE6 och
    standarder, är en investering för en växande andel användare och framtiden, medan
    fokus på IE6 optimering är ett fokus på en minskande andel användare och historien.
    Kanske är det inte gynnsamt att arbeta med IE6, kanske är det därför inte, som
    vissa här hävdar, en UI-utvecklares uppgift.

  comment_content: '@Marcus Andersson: I see where you''re coming from, and I agree
    that there''s a scale here, from the special case that''s this blog, to and intranet
    where everyone is using IE6. No, it''s not always possible to skip IE6.\n\nThe
    final decision is usually not up to the web developer, but they often start with
    the web developer. You know all the arguments of why to develop to standards,
    you just have to get your boss or marketing manager to hear them. It might take
    a week or discussing back and forth, but it''s so worth it. \n\nI want to urge
    people to initiate that discussion now, because the IE6 market share is actually
    shrinking...'

  comment_content: '@Kristoffer Nolgren: I agree with you: Making money and making
    great user experiences are not always the same thing. At least not in the short
    term... I think it most often is the same in the long term though...\n\nIn a competitive
    situation, you need to innovate faster than your competitors. Interface development
    might be one of the things that slow you down, if IE6 development takes too much
    time. The more you''ve worked with educational upgrade messages, asking people
    to upgrade and why they will benefit from it, the more time you''ll have in the
    future to innovate. \n\nAnother example of economy vs. experience is ads. In the
    short term, adding banners to a site makes you money, in the long term people
    get annoyed by the cluttered interface you give them, and might look elsewhere.\n\nIt''s
    interesting to think if IE6 development in those terms, thanks for bringing it
    up!'

    of funny. IE in total has about a 20% share with IE6 at just above 5%. What's
    really funny is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget" rel="nofollow"><strong>wget</strong></a>
    is not far behind at 3%. wget accounting for an almost as big a share of the users
    as IE6 must say something.

    as I want to do something about it, I have this haunting voice inside my head
    that says "IE6 is down to a 20% marketshare in the browser world. Firefox is up
    to a 20% marketshare. Would I alienate Firefox users?" NO WAY. Most of my clients
    are trying to generate leads and get sales with their websites. I want every visitor
    I can get...even the 20% with the old browser.

  comment_content: I have to say this was an interesting post to read. Not surprisingly
    a lot of opinions followed and I have been in similar discussions lately. In these
    cases the sites have had relatively defined targeted groups where IE7 is the default
    browser so I suppose I’ve been lucky. I also understand that it is not always
    possible to skip the IE6 support but it is definitely worth trying (with good
    arguments).\n\nI agree in what you are saying, put the money and time in new features
    instead of old heritage.

  comment_content: I recently completed work on the overhaul of a project management
    web application, and was able to specify that IE6 would not be supported. It was
    a great feeling and sped up the development process significantly!\n\nHowever,
    typically when I am working on client sites I do still test in IE6. I no longer
    aim for pixel perfection in IE6, and spend only the miniumum amount of time required
    to fix IE6 display errors.\n\nOn my blog and personal sites I test in IE7+. If
    someone is reading a web development blog and still using IE6, they seriously
    need to consider working in a different industry!\n\nBut in all honesty, I don't
    think that IE6 is all that difficult to accomodate. Does anyone remember IE5,
    ir IE5 Mac? (shudder) Those browers were a NIGHTMARE to code for. IE6 is a walk
    in the park by comparison. Still, I won't mourn its passing!

  comment_content: '@Jonathan Nicol: Thanks for your comment! Yeah, the speedup really
    is significant if you can drop IE6 support. It''s not so much that it''s hard
    to support, it''s all the time it consumes.... I know the ins and outs of IE6,
    I just hate going through hoops to do what it needs, downgrading features because
    it can''t handle them. \n\nI''ve come to use your second tactic when customers
    have few IE6 users that they can''t ignore. I just make the text readable, and
    the major flows work as they should, and let the design look a bit messy. Always
    with a warning, and a message for the user to upgrade. \n\nI agree that we can
    find worse browsers than IE6 to support, but I think that''s beside the point.
    We need a better environment to be productive in, and that requires the immediate
    death of IE6. *Loads gun*'

  comment_content: managed users can't upgrade their web browsers and the web department
    generally doesn't control group policy. if anyone outside of a managed environment
    hasn't updated their web-browser to one that works properly yet i would begin
    to question their sanity.  on my personal site, i capture if ie &lt; 8 and tell
    them to bugger off, &quot;your browser fails miserably, go away&quot;. then again,
    i'm not selling anything and don't have any customers / followers to speak of.

  comment_content: '@tswaters: Don''t do it in one step. Start by telling users that
    you will be stopping support soon. That gives locked-in users some arguments to
    give their IT-departments. Even YouTube is doing just that. You can too.'

  comment_content: I appreciate your thoughts, Emil. The projector illustrates an
    accessibility problem I would not have guessed at.\n\nAccessibility is one of
    my highest priorities, and today I build to standards as best I can and test with
    Firefox, Opera, Safari, Lynx, IE7 and IE8. Then, like Jonathan Nicol, I make adjustments
    to anything that's broken in IE6.\n\nWhat's chaining us all to IE6 is the corporate
    and government system administrators who refuse to upgrade, and have no real incentive
    to upgrade. Many designed their intranets with FrontPage or some other monster
    that churned out sloppy proprietary Microsoft code. In a closed system, with IE6
    users only, their code does what they want it to do. Standards compliance is not
    a problem for them, because for them there is only one browser.\n\nSo the question
    is, what can we do to give these people the incentive and the tools that will
    move them out of the Dark Ages? I'd love to hear what you and some of your other
    readers suggest.

    is the same one I use, and what I would perceive to be best practice in the industry.
    Would love to skip the last step there...\n\n"Arguments for IT administrators"
    is a great idea for a new blog post, I''ll see if I can think up some thoughts
    worthy of publishing :)'

  comment_content: You will lose some readers by using the 2nd point in your article
    but you'll make them think twice before using IE6 as a valid browser in 2009.\n\nIn
    the past month i have had 5% of visitors using IE6..

  comment_content: The big issue with older browsers is their security. With so many
    patches not fixed in ie6 it is no wonder that there are so many bots.\nThe problem
    with making a website not accessable to a certain group i.e. ie6 and earlier is
    the law where so mnay countries are implementing accessability laws which puts
    the onus of the accessability onto the company and website designer.\nBecause
    there is the chance of a lawsuite over accessability websites in theory still
    have to accommodate ie6 and then have to perpetrate the bots and hackers.\nThe
    arguement is not about what browsers to accommodate regardless of market share
    but websites should be allowed to drop older browsers because of improving security
    on the internet.\nOnce this approach is taken then the security issues will not
    be so common and hackers will ahve to work harder and companys will not have so
    much down time on their servers and waste money fixing viruses,trojans etc.

  comment_content: 20% of my users are still using IE6 and providing support for IE6
    is a must for me. I`m not interested why they are using IE6, is there choice,
    what is interesting for me is that they view my site corectly.

  comment_content: 'I really cannot understand why these guys are still using IE6.
    My websites are not looking very fancy in this browser because I''m using a lot
    of new design tehnics which IE6 obviously doesn''t recognize well!\n\nAs you said
    in the article, we should encourage guys to upgrade, but I have a strong presumption
    that these users don''t know how to hit more than 2-3 clicks on a browser, and
    always with the fear that they might ruin their pc. They often use the net for
    reading newspapers or simple news websites. This is sad, but to be honest, frankly,
    I don''t need such visitors. As their potency on the net is too low for getting
    any of the products I offer.\n\nPS: Why come IE automatic update is not the same
    like for windows update? MS should put at obligation their people for an update.
    Or has it something to do with the license? If you don''t have it, you can''t
    update?\n\nThanks for any answers! Excited about this new community!'

  comment_content: The only reason IE has a dominant market share is because Microsoft
    bundles it with Windows. Microsoft is unmotivated to improve their browser because
    of IE's monopoly. The open-source browsers will one day take over the market,
    and Microsoft will finally make an innovative version of IE.

  comment_content: 'Well you spot anything new, and it''s not the first time I read
    something like this. As you notice, until the market share of IE6 drops under
    % we should always take care of it when producing web contents. Obviously I''m
    referring to sites that actually include that kind of target. Currently I''m working
    with this key in mind: for mainstream browsers the site should be "perfect", on
    IE6 it should be "usable", never spending too much time on adjusting margins or
    strange absolute boxes positions: at least the user will not be disappointed and
    can browse through the site without problems.'

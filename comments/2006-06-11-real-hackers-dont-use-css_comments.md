  comment_content: Hej Emil!\n\nDet var en av de roligaste artiklarna jag har läst
    på länge! Underbar referens till Ferdinand.\n\nI've actually never used tables
    for layout. They're complicated. I've used frames, which was OK, but I get really
    annoyed when Aftonbladet's ungtval06 site uses them. I mean, 2006 and frames??!\n\nTime
    to start arguing about xhtml 1.1 sometimes soon? Using it for all my new sites.
    It's really good because if you can't make mistakes, or it won't work ;). Also,
    it's nice to be able to use MathML and SVG when they come widely accepted.

  comment_content: Nice article, and I know you meant this as a satire, and I myself
    work on the programming end of web for a living ... but... real hackers don't
    do websites.  (For the rest of the world, check out the entry for "hacker" in
    the Jargon File).

  comment_content: Nice post, Emil. A brief and nearly violent history of the web.
    Very well put.\n\nI wonder what you think about truly allowing designers to have
    what they want. If you look at the CSS Zen Garden, you can see how flexible and
    creative any designer can be using CSS, positioning, DIVs, and background images
    (just like your site has so well taught us). Slices are still important, so to
    speak, but in a completely different way. Am I right?

  comment_content: '@Eric TF Bat: A little bit over the top if you ask me. We both
    know that replacing tr/td with div/span is actually a huge step in the right direction,
    and validation proves it, not to mention semantics, structural markup, and page
    code size. While I cannot disagree with your zealous approach to using standards
    correctly, tossing out tables for divs usually leads to properly separating style
    from content, and even that idea is imperfect at best. There''s a swell A List
    Apart article that details the difficulties with even that approach, for doesn''t
    the structural markup require ids and classes to utilize the style effectively?'

    Well, I am also a blogger, so no offense there. But the milestones as described

  comment_content: I am currently completing research on the use of CSS. In viewing
    many CSS sites, using adaptive technologies I have found that many of the sites
    are not reading correctly. Using JAWS the sites are read top to bottom left to
    right, and in many cases this means that JAWS is reading in side navigation with
    the content. \n\nThe same issue was occuring with ZoomText, when it was chosen
    to read the page, it reads top to bottom and left to right, and includes side
    navigation in the readings. \n\nThis is a huge issue, and one that does not seem
    to be mentioned a lot. \n\nI think it may be a placement issue, and more than
    likely incorrect coding, however there seems to be an assumption that CSS is the
    panacea to all accesibiity issues, and this thinking concerns me.\n\nIf there
    are any usability testing that has occured in regards to CSS, I would be interested
    in reading the reports. \n\nRegards\n\nJennifer

  comment_content: There's one very wrong point in how those "Designers" think. As
    you already wrote, they took their pretty print design and wanted to make the
    web page look like that. So in fact they where print designers, not web designers.
    But web pages are not limited to one media. Sure, you could print a web page and
    then get the exact look of the former printed flyer. But obviously navigational
    elements are pointless on printed paper. So simply from that point it should be
    obviously a difference between a web page and a printed paper. This difference
    is the main point in all those misunderstanding between the "hackers" and the
    "designers". Although i think both names are used wrong here. Hackers are designers,
    too. They do design functionality. This is a very important part of design as
    well. Design is not only about painting pretty images.

  comment_content: I think we both get the point, but out in the wild the term "Designer"
    is closely related to graphical design. So the term "Web Designer" today just
    simply is a "Screen painter". This assiciation is not good for the whole profession.

  comment_content: Oh you nitpicking semantics people.  Don't you know that all this
    messing around with new fangled ideas can be solved with a little line that says
    "Optimised for / Best viewed in" with a list of what specific browser, screen
    resolution, operating system and a big list of all the client-side stuff the user
    should spend hours obtaining and installing, then come back to view your site
    how you wanted them to see it.\n\nAnd if you're worried about people getting bored
    while they are doing all that, stick a big flash animated loading screen for them
    to look at.  Don't forget to give a link for those who haven't got flash player
    installed yet though!!\n\nSeriously, happened upon this page at work whilst I
    was browsing sites to improve my CSS skills and it brightened up my afternoon.  So
    much rings true.

  comment_content: Hey, i was one these guys which used frames and tables, too. :-)\nI
    can remember very well, how it was when I started using CSS and XHTML for tableless,
    semantic Webdesign. Some colleagues were annoyed, cause they didn't want to change
    their ways of working.\nNice article!

  comment_content: Never in my career as a web developer have I been called a hacker
    or called a fellow web dever a hacker....we aren't hackers...\n\n\nHackers hack
    things. They gain access. We are developers.

  comment_content: A good site is built using mix of all the technologies and content
    required for balanced look. With today's high speed internet, an all-text site
    isn't really of the same value as it was a decade ago. Just today while searching
    for some web development needs, I came across a site having blend of flash, images,
    css, tables and simple html - it was superb. In case someone needs to verify my
    comments u can see for yrself at http://www.cursivebits.com

  comment_content: Funny! :D\n\nThe funniest thing about SOAP is that you could use
    it together with Ajax. We need a recommendation spelled Alternate Quality User
    Attributes or something to make it whole.

  comment_content: 'Just as a side note ;) All of them are not recommendations. \n\n*
    HTML+TIME is a Note published mainly written by Microsoft and implemented in IE.
    The same principles are implemented in SMIL\n\n* Predefined Icons is a *Working
    Draft* from *1996*. ;) so not a spec.\n\n* Curie is still a *Last Call Working
    Draft*. The next step should be candidate recommendation calling for implementations.
    It is a highly debated document. You are welcome to leave comments about it.\n\n*
    Micropayments in HTML was a Working Draft (1999). The Activity has stopped. The
    Work didn''t find enough support. You have to imagine a context of this time.
    The question: How do we finance the business of online services? Advertisements
    was almost not existent. In France, the Minitel was a network of computer with
    successful micropayment at the time. Another path has been taken. Though somehow
    micropayment exists through the Mobile communications for example.\n\n* Same story.
    1997\n\n* CSS3 Marquee. In development, still a WD, you are welcome to send your
    comments to the appropriate mailing list.\n\n* Accessibility for Old People is
    a very interesting documents. Work from WAI is used by many governments, institutions
    to define their policies development on accessibility. Many developed countries
    are having older and older users.  Again this is a Working Draft it doesn''t mean
    it will become a Recommendation, it could end up as a Note.\n\nBasically what
    you are saying is that W3C has a system of publication with a strong policy of
    maintenance. It helps give stable references to documents in development. A Document
    depending on its maturity level, the market, the lack of implementations, etc.
    will stay a WD, becomes a note or eventually becomes a W3C Recommendation.\n\nHope
    it helps to understand.'

  comment_content: '@Karl Dubost: Nope, most of them are not recommendations, it was
    quite hard to find that many silly ones. Note that I didn''t explicitly said so
    either :)\n\nI see that as a W3C representative you don''t have any  personal
    opinions about their silliness. Would be interesting to hear them! Thanks for
    the additional info though, appreciate it!'

  comment_content: 'I gave my opinion and explained why it made sense at the time
    it was published for some of them. Being an active participant of the Web and
    its development since its birth, it is always good to remember the historical
    context of their developments. For the recent ones:\n\n1. marquee (liking it or
    not) will not go away. But that would be better if it was not a tag, then the
    CSS rules for it. That said it doesn''t mean it will reach Rec stage. This will
    determine by implementation phase: Candidate Recommendation.\n\n2. Accessibility
    for Old People is far to be silly, but on this one I''m not sure how to convince
    you more than you spend time reading the document if not done yet. :)\n\nIndeed
    some things look silly retrospectively, it''s often why they didn''t go to Rec.
    but at the time they were topics often worth exploring and which help pushing
    the limits for future specifications. ;)'

  comment_content: '@Karl Dubost: I see, but you sounded so official :) I guess that''s
    something you learn working with W3C too. \n\nI have no problem with specs going
    into the recommendation stage, silly or not. As a web developer, I can myself
    decide what implementation I want to make use of. It''s a system that works pretty
    well.\n\n1. Marquee: The thing that feels bad about this one is that we''re doing
    things with CSS that could easily be done with js. In my mind, animation is something
    that is better fitted to be handled in a scripting environment.\n\n2. Old people:
    I have no problem with what it says, it''s  the form of it is really strange.
    The section that''s supposed to contain recommendations is empty, and everything
    before that is a literature review. That seems more like a research effort than
    a recommendation to me.\n\nI agree that it''s a sign of saneness that some of
    them didn''t go into the recommendation stage :)'

  comment_content: 'Chuckling at "sounded official" ;) I have usually a (bad?) tendency
    to try to stay neutral. Humour is a difficult thing to carry through this little
    box with someone you don''t know. \n\nAbout animation: declarative vs programmative.
    Long discussions with good arguments in both camps. Often declarative is something
    which is easier to handle for users with no big skills. HTML is relatively easy,
    a level of abstraction more is CSS, Javascript is then completly another world.\n\nSMIL
    Animation (included in SVG) is all about declarative animation, much easier to
    use than programming the same functionalities. \n\nTR/ doesn''t only contain technical
    specifications, but also guidelines, notes, primers, etc. It can be indeed misleading
    sometimes.'

  comment_content: I actually like the idea of pre-defined icons, would be especially
    useful for mobile platforms.

  comment_content: Hilarious...even though some aren't in spec.  But still a good
    list and a good laugh.

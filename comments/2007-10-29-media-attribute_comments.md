  comment_content: hey emil,\n\n'If you build a web development blog, you use an image
    of blueish sky' - lol, so true (not good). hope you're well.\n\nso let me get
    this straight; are you advocating [no] media attributes whatsoever, or separate,
    conditional, styles aimed at specific browsers/hardware?\n\nwithout using the
    media attribute i don't think i know of a way to specify a stylesheet for a device
    outright? - shed some light?

  comment_content: '@lewis: I don''t advocate anything, very diplomatic, right? ;)
    Now, one way not to use the media attribute is to detect the browser on the User-agent
    string, and send then off to a custom page. You still need to do that to customize
    your content...'

  comment_content: 'ahh, this is quite relevant as i''m building an analytics system
    for logging site traffic this week. until now i didn''t know what user agent strings
    were. nice one; i''m glad i commented now :) \n\nstill... for someone less into
    server-stuff there is no other option but to use the media attribute, i take it?\n\ni
    must admit i don''t have every type of media end product (for the list: http://tinyurl.com/7llod)
    to experiment with so half the time i just take it for granted that  it will work
    - relying on standards to automate the leg work. not every client asks for their
    site to work on x end mediums though - how do you factor in this aspect in your
    projects, or do you treat it arbitrarily?'

  comment_content: For Wikipedia, though, having a style sheet for print media works
    really well.

  comment_content: You make a slew of good points but i'd like to throw another out
    there. If one does use the @media handheld they coyld also be taking the position
    that they can create a page with relevant enough content and navigibility for
    mobiles but still have design and content relative to larger screens. This what
    what I personally try on my personal site. and I think that challenge of designing
    for two media types is good for growth.

    with good results, but that’s not all it’s there for."\n\n@Antoine: Yes, it''s
    really a challenge to make that work well.'

    been thinking for a while about the media attribute on link tags. Some people

  comment_content: Emil, that is pure genius!  I had to close the window within 3
    seconds, I could feel a seizure coming on, honestly.  I'll have to see what I
    can cook up.  Fun idea.

  comment_content: The first thing I thought was I should make a page that has span
    tags with a class of blink and JavaScript that finds all those spans and uses
    setTimeout to implement the blink... I think it's because I'm a sick, sick man.\n\nP.S.
    I'm stealing your preview box idea.

  comment_content: '@Majik Sznak: sounds interesting, do you have an URL available
    to that blink thingie? :)\n\nThe previewbox is a Wordpress plugin (not mine),
    I just plugged it in and added some styling. It''s called <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview"

  comment_content: I whipped together a page in a few minutes, by request.  It's mostly
    just geocities-inspired bad design, though using CSS.  There's also a fun javascript
    function to add to the annoyingness...\n\n<a href="http://www.jess2.net/fun/fugly/"

  comment_content: We serious web masters often need to communicate to visitors that
    our web sites are not yet finished. This way, they will know to make our site
    their homepage and check back regularly. I have solved this common problem once
    and for all.\n\n<a href="http://www.thefutureoftheweb.com/demo/brutal.html" rel="nofollow">Under

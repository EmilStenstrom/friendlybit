  comment_content: '@Robert Nyman: No you''re right. I''m pretty sure that the default
    character encoding is UTF-8 if nothing else is specified. Is there any known caveates
    with that?\n\nBtw, see how nicely we avoided inline styles ;)'

  comment_content: Not sure. But why not just specify it to make sure? :-)\n\nOtherwise
    it looks very good and it's commendable that such an institution get such good
    code on its site.

  comment_content: '@exe: In fact it does. In this example you can check the HTTP
    response and you''ll see: <code>Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8</code>'

  comment_content: Robert, specifying character encoding with a META element is supposed
    to be interpreted by the server so that the server can send the correct HTTP headers.
    It is not intended for the UA. However, in reality servers ignore it and browsers
    honor it if the server didn't specify any character encoding. In any case, there's
    no need to specify the character encoding with a META element when the server
    is correctly configured.

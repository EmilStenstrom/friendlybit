  comment_content: Or you could just stop using Outlook. \n\nAlso, Outlook has been
    known to peek inside zip files. Using a more obscure compression like tar.bz2
    might do the trick though.

  comment_content: I often create a temporary Yahoo Group and upload files there.
    I then invite people who are interested in getting the file to download it from
    there. Gives you some level of anonymity, some security, and often works through
    most fire walls.\n\nRegards

  comment_content: I noticed the same thing with Outlook a while ago at work. I was
    supposed to solve a font problem on a HTML file and Outlook made my work a lot
    harder by messing the file up. I'm glad I was able to notice the changes that
    Outlook made to the file, otherwise I might have been stuck with the problem for
    a long time.\n\nI'm also glad I don't have to use MS products at home.

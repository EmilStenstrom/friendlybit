  comment_content: I'm definitely with you, Django is a lot of fun. Thanks for sharing
    the slides.\n\nIn the list of sites that use Django, you could almost have put
    Jaiku there as they're in the process of rewriting it with Django for use in Google
    App Engine. Thought you like to know ;)

  comment_content: Ah, so you've found django to, and even held a speach on it!  I'll
    have to agree, Django makes coding web apps as fun as it should be again!  :-)

  comment_content: Django is fantastic. I work in Polopoly now, and it feels ... heavy.
    In many sort of ways.\n\nWould be nice to see your take of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk"
    rel="nofollow">Cal Henderson hating Django</a> in a future blog post. :)

  comment_content: '@Anders Ytterström: You''re not looking for a new job are you?
    There''s lots of people here working with both polopoly and other cms:es. Interested?\n\nOn
    the Cal Henderson video: It''s a good one. I really like his style, and that it''s
    kinda hard to know if he''s serious or not. I haven''t ran into any of the problems
    he mentions, yet.'

  comment_content: 'Nice to see that you have found Django too, we need more publicity
    for Django from good Swedish bloggers. Keep up the good work! Will download the
    PDF now and have a read.\n\nOh, and regarding the Cal Henderson-video: can''t
    you see that he''s totally serious, he has a beard fer crissake!'

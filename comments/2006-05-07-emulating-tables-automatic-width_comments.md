  comment_content: '[...] Moving from tables to layouts based on CSS is a tough move
    for many. Things don’t behave the way they use to and some effects are much harder
    to do with CSS. This article is about one of the tricks you might want when trying
    to get table-like effects using CSS: the dynamic width column, where you let the
    width be decided by an image. [...]'

  comment_content: Just a further clarification on IE and !important:\n\nIE only ignores
    !important if there's another declaration in the same {} for the same property.
    So your example is fine and cool, but in general !important <em>will</em> work
    with IE.

  comment_content: '@karl: Sure is, problem is that it doesn''t work with IE right
    now (the reason I didn''t include it). If it did it would be the best way to do
    all sorts of layouts.'

  comment_content: Best way I found to force layout on IE elements is by using the
    property {zoom:1}. This is completely ignored by other browsers and affects the
    IE elements as intended.

  comment_content: '@Andrew: I don''t like the zoom attribute since it''s proprietary
    code that doesn''t validate. Validation is important imo. I do use it sometimes
    just to check if something is a hasLayout issue in IE, but that never sticks to
    the final version.'

  comment_content: It's just to let you know that your article was *very* helpful
    as I was searching a way to make a main column shrink or expand based on the width
    of a sidebar (that could be shown in a page and not shown in another).\nIt finished
    my search!\nThanks

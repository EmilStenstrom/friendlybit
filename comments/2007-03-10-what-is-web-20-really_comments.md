  comment_content: Nice article. I however think that to get sold to a bigger company
    (Yahoo, Google etc) may be the business plan in the long run. This is also known
    as an exit plan in the business world.\n\nJust look at YouTube, I'm sure the purpose
    for the owner (Google) is different now after the acquisition than before. I can't
    say all this was planned when YouTube started, and many "web 2.0" probably don't
    have a business plan even in as an exit plan, but it still worked out pretty good
    for the founders :)

  comment_content: '@Antti Kupila: It sure did work out in the end for many Web 2.0
    companies. But my question is whether business plans should be included in Web
    2.0 at all. Selling to a bigger company is not very Web 2.0:ish to me...'

  comment_content: Good analysis of Web 2.0!  I probably wouldn't have dissed O'Reilly's
    definition (isn't he close to deity?) but to each his own.

  comment_content: insightful article. thanks for the time.\n\nif only someone would
    come up with a web tool that prohibits web publishers (self professed 'web designers?!')
    from exhibiting the w3c validation icon for the fun of it.

  comment_content: Hey!\nThanks for the interesting article. The part about "Syndication
    of Content and Services" I considered to be very important. The "Web 2.0" Generation
    (or whatever you might call them) discovers the potential of the internet not
    solely for information distribution purposes but for integrating and creating
    whole new services.

  comment_content: Very good article. It's something I can refer people to when explaining
    to people the definition of Web 2.0.\n\nBtw, came across this site randomly the
    other day -- love all your articles about web dev. Thanks!

  comment_content: Personally, I think Web 2.0 is a bunch of bullshit. These days,
    calling a website Web 2.0 is the same as calling it good. I am writing a post
    about this on my upcoming blog.\n\nWeb 2.0 is just a buzzword that helps companies
    attract developers. It doesn't mean anything. It's an effective buzzword, yes,
    but a buzzword nonetheless.\n\nIt doesn't matter what it actually means, it's
    misused. Nowadays, when people think of a Web 2.0 web application, they think
    of a modern, flashy, interactive web app with rounded corners and Ajax. That's
    not what Web 2.0 is at all. (Or at least not what it was originally meant to be.)
    I say the only time you should use the phrase is in marketing, because I do have
    to admit it is an effective eye-catcher.

  comment_content: '@Sasha: I guess you didn''t read the article? It has a rather
    specific definition, that I hear lots of people agree with... Sure, there will
    be people that only focus on the technology part, AJAX, RSS, and so on, but we
    all know that there''s more to it than that... Lets educate people.'

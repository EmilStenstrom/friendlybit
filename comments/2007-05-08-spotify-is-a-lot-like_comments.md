  comment_content: slightly off-topic, but if anyone can suggest an alternative to
    winamp it'd be appreciated. something that has built in volume normalisation would
    be a massive plus. ruined speakers at 130dB is never a good thing.\n\nback on
    track lastfm + soulseek combo is the best thing since firefox.\n\nbig up emil!

    neat, think it's got quite good  volume normalisation

  comment_content: Spotify is pointless for anybody that goes mobile and doesn't have
    a computer or wireless. I still want to have my music on my hard drive to listen
    to whenever and wherever I please, without some BS gimmick. I'd gladly pay if
    they offered downloads in high quality formats without DRM, but until then, this
    is just another toy. The biggest use it has is finding new artists, nothing more.

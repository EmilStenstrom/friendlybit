  comment_content: Urgency?  Well ... not really, in the general sense (for each application,
    of course the urgency is there, but for the web as a whole, there's not so much
    hurry).\n\nI'll ask today "what is silverlight?"  In a few years, I'm quite confidend
    I'll ask "what was silverlight?" if I even remember that any such thing existed
    ...\n\nMeanwhile, plain old web has apps like google maps, librarything, booli.se,
    wikipedia, ... and more practically by the day!\n\nSo no.  I'm not the least bit
    worried that microsoft will take over the world.  They failed that in 1996.

  comment_content: Hmmm... Well, standards work, and especially standards implementations,
    does take a long time, and I'd definitely say that the failing part is the implementation
    one.\n\nSilverlight and Flex/Flash are definitely trying to compete with that,
    but given the number of drawbacks with those technologies, I don't think they
    will kill off the web as we know it. I think a lot of people don't really need
    flashy web sites either, it's rather about communities, sharing and so on.\n\nIt's
    not like Facebook would be more popular if it had a lot of Flash apps in it (I
    think not, at least :-) ).\n\nBut with that said, naturally I really think web
    browsers, across the line, should have proper built-in support for real column
    handling, animations, vector grapchics etc, etc.

  comment_content: <blockquote cite="friendly bit">Say you are a pro open standards
    developer, like me. What tools do you have to grab people’s attention? Valid HTML?
    DIVs with fading color? AJAX? No way man. A good Flash developer can get a wow
    reaction by the time you’ve chosen doctype (or at least by the time you’ve booted
    IE6).</blockquote>\n\nI can deliver <strong>information</strong>, information
    marked up with semantic, standardize, rocksolid HTML. As long as those big flash
    websites don't deliver just that, I'm going to continue with my stuff. And for
    that I don't need Javascript, Photoshop or any other extraordinary things.

  comment_content: '@Emil Stenström: What level? HTML in it''s most simplest way is
    a splendid way of delivering information, and that''s what it''s all about.\n\nI
    think it''s great that they are working towards getting things right, but I''m
    not worried about the future. HTML is the way to go. Then if we where going to
    spice up our HTML with some unobtrusive JavaScript to enhance the experience it''s
    all good!\n\nAnother thing: <blockquote><p>To do any kind of animation, you need
    a big Javascript library, because browser makers have not yet (yes, it’s 2008)
    been able to collaborate on how the language should work. </p></blockquote>\n\njQuery
    is about 15kb, DOMAssistant 7kb. And with todays internet connections, I wouldn''t
    say thats a problem, they make life easier.'

  comment_content: When I walked home from work I thought "Maybe I misunderstood everything
    about Emils post". But then again  I thought some more and Silverlight, Flash,
    Flex or any other media wont beat pure HTML. Not for many years at least....

  comment_content: '@icaaq: While I hope you''re right, but I don''t think that''s
    the case.  \n\nMore and more non-technical people are getting involved in web
    design who care nothing about the code being elegant, maintainable and up to standards.  Instead
    they point their meaty finger at the screen showing justintimberlake.com and say,
    "There! I want it to look just like that!"\n\nGood luck trying to tell the person
    that signs your paycheques he can''t have it because it''s not standards compliant.  There''s
    a lineup of people outside the door who are more than happy to sell their soul
    and take your place.'

    just a lucky guy!\n\nAnd as long as Silverlight and Flash is in a plugin-war with
    no proper standard. the big cornersstone of internet, HTML will not fall! Mark

  comment_content: Add JavaFX to the mix. With most developers being comfortable with
    the environment, libraries, etc. JavaFX can get a following pretty quickly.\n\nI
    played around with Flex this summer and it's not bad. Flash is often avoided due
    to SEO issues (unless it's a short term tadaa! website), but if they fix that,
    Flex looks like a winner.\n\nAs for Silverlight, it will go the way of vbscript.
    I think the HTML/CSS/AJAX combination is here to stay.

  comment_content: 90% of the time I come across a page using Flash or some other
    technology I groan. Painfully slow page loads, miserable accessability, etc, etc.
    There's a reason it's called flash and not substance.\n\nWe are increasingly seeing
    these 'flashy' technologies, like AJAX, like Silverlight, being abused at the
    expense of people even wanting to USE the website in the first place. I hit a
    page with flash for navigation, AJAX for content, download times measured in minutes
    on my 15mbps connect - all for stuff that could just as easily be a static image
    - you know what I do?\n\nI go to another site!!! ...and I'm hardly alone in this
    attitude.\n\nUrgency for flashy rubbish? None. Me, I have an entirely different
    tack - people go to websites NOT for your flashy bullshit. They go to websites
    for the CONTENT. As such, content first in Minimalist Semantic Markup is the order
    of the day.\n\nHow do I sell this to prospective clients? Simple, I explain accessability,
    UK accessability FINES, lowered maintennance costs, ease of content management,
    ease of re-skinning the whole page without having to re-enter all the content,
    lowered operating costs and faster page loads by way of less bandwidth used and
    better use of caching models.\n\nYou have to explain and educate - showing them
    that sure, that page they are holding up as an example is really pretty... but
    there's no content for search engines or screen readers to see, people can't link
    directly to subpages reducing the likelyhood of backlinks because AJAX is being
    used as a replacement for FRAMESETS, and it's 120+ files meaning that on the average
    we're talking anywhere from 60 to 100 seconds overhead just from handshaking -
    BEFORE we even talk about bandwidth. <i>(good luck with your site places like
    Utah and the Dakota's where you are lucky if you can get a solid 33.6k dialup
    connection)</i>\n\nAgain, there's a reason it's called flash and not substance,
    there's a REASON framesets are frowned upon, and a time and place to use technologies
    like AJAX and Silverlight.\n\nUnfortunately your flashtards end up throwing these
    technologies at everything whether it's the right tool or not.

  comment_content: '@Jason: Thanks for a well articulated comment! As I say in the
    article: To me there''s a fight going on between Silverlight, JavaFX, Flash, and
    HTML/CSS/JS. The open web stack is winning right now, but we are seeing rapid
    development in the first three, and almost none in the last. People building Silverlight
    are developing accessibility features and Flash people are thinking of open-sourcing.
    Why does not anyone seem to realize that the open web urgently need to take the
    fight with them?'

  comment_content: mmm, again, emil, you utter the words that are so often tumbling
    around my head. having just finished my degree i've constantly been in flux as
    to whether to pursue a standards compliant course of action or jump ship (not
    that i'm saying that's what's on your mind) and opt for the flashy route over
    the past three years (being a designer, not a developer at heart).\n\ni think
    at the end of the day the best advice you can give to someone in this state of
    flux is to do what you enjoy, do what you're good at, become the best and everything
    from there on it will slot into place nicely. hell, all the good blogs surround
    standards based stuff, like yours, not flash or anything else, so i gauge a lot
    from that alone.\n\nagain, you've left me something to ponder over for the day.\n\nps.
    digin' the new look of the site - kinda backs up your mulling aptly really.

  comment_content: '@lewis litanzios: Thanks for the kind words. I hope to do just
    that, get people something to ponder about, or at least put what they do in a
    bigger context. \n\nI really miss Flash/Silverlight/JavaFX features in HTML/CSS/JS,
    and I really hope that they start to pop up soon... That would make your choice
    a lot easier :)'

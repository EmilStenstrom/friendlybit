  comment_content: Hi Emil,↵First of all congrats on your blog. I've been reading
    about the new pages that you launched and I have to say that I find a very good
    idea the launching of Kundo.se. it's too bad I can't read Sweddish but the idea
    of it and how it was developed has really caught my interest. Do you think these
    types of meetings are getting held in the UK as well? If so, where can I find
    more information?↵↵Cheers,↵↵Meri

  comment_content: '@Meri: I''m sure there''s 24h business camps in the UK too, but
    I''m afraid I don''t know where, or when. Why don''t you get a group of friends
    together and organize one? It could be a great way to advertise your seo tool
    (whose ad I removed from your comment, sorry). Good luck!'

  comment_content: Congratulations on the launching of your two sites and Uttråkad.se
    isn't doing bad so far with↵70 unique visitors everyday. Kundo.se can prove useful
    too with all of its facilities to embed feedback widgets. Last but not the least
    I would like to go and explore the 3rd site as it sounds a good meeting place
    and is a development blog. (But its in Swedish)↵↵ So have to wait till you launch
    a site in English.

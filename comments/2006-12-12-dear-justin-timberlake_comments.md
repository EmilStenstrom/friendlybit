  comment_content: Hi,\n\nI truly appreciate your open love to me, and it goes without
    saying that i admire the firing passion you show towards me. \n\nNonetheless i
    do agree with you on my website. And i wish we could get together and let me snuggle
    up some of your nerdiness, because you truly snatched my attention. \n\nPlease
    do leave me an e-mail at justin@justintimberlake.com\n\nsinserly,\n\nJustin

  comment_content: 'For what it''s worth, HTML 3.0 was actually never "released" (nor
    actually implemented), however you missed a spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html"
    rel="nofollow">HTML+</a> (also never released nor implemented).\n\nHTML5 now has
    &lt;figure&gt;, although it''s not quite like &lt;fig&gt; in HTML+ or HTML 3.0.
    \n\nNotes and annotations have been discussed on the list and is being considered
    I believe.\n\nIf you (or someone else) think something is missing in HTML5 then

  comment_content: '&lt;note> sounds awesome!\nI too have all these little notes in
    all my sites and apps, that all go in a  or  element with an associated class,
    but  would be far more appropriate.'

  comment_content: The HTML5 proposal also includes (among others) the predefined
    classes "note", "warning", "error" and "search" which seem applicable here.

  comment_content: '@zcorpan: I don''t need your stinkin'' mail list :) I''ll talk
    to you directly instead :)\n\n@Anne van Kesteren: Good to hear, I have some thoughts
    on using classes for added semantics, but that''s a different post. Thanks for
    your clarification.'

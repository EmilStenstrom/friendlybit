  comment_content: 'Just a thought - perhaps it is the comments as a phenomena doesn''t
    fit into the modern decentralized web..\n\nI know that people like Jeremy Keith
    has argued that comments shouldn''t be made at blogs but rather in alternate ways:
    <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1331" rel="nofollow">http://adactio.com/journal/1331</a>\n\nPerhaps
    comments should be made at the commenters own blogs and thus be a real part of
    the blogosphere linked to the commented post through a usual URL-link?\n\nThat
    way you will automatically get all blogcomments from people whose blogs you follow
    in a similar fashion to how you will get all comments as well as all entries from
    people you''re following on jaiku.\n\nTo jump further into the blogosphere you''ll
    just follow the links in each post.\n\nPerhaps that''s a bit extreme - but it
    would at least make it easier to track quality content throughout the blogosphere...'

  comment_content: Ahum... blogs will receive far more comments if their feeds were
    well-formed and allowed the <b><i>user</i></b> to choose whether to show the summary
    / text only version or the full web-version of the post....\n\nI use Thunderbird
    as my feed reader and luckely most feeds give me the above choice. With only a
    few exceptions, I always choose to view the full version which will include the
    comments.\n\nSeeing comments elicits comments as you rightfully notice and I comment
    far more often on blogs which show comments / give me the choice to view the post
    as if I were viewing the web page.\n\nUnfortunately I am not given that choice
    when feeds are routed through feedburner <i>as yours is</i>.\nIt is a pet peeve
    of me, but at the end of the day I think it is the authors who get burned by it.

  comment_content: '@Pelle: On wordpress blogs trackbacks (comments on other blogs)
    and ordinary comments are handled exactly the same. You could of course write
    a plugin that treats them different but few do that. I would like to argue that
    it''s just as important to show trackbacks (with real content) as it is to show
    on-site comments.\n\nAlso, I''m not sure if that''s what you mean, but I would
    also like it to be easy for new people to contribute, even though I don''t "follow"
    them. The twitter model is worse at that...\n\n@Jrf: I see what you mean. I used
    Thunderbird before, and just like you used to look at the whole page (with design)
    instead of just some posts. I have no idea how Thunderbird differentiates what
    blogs to show in full, and what blogs to only show the text from. The link to
    the full post is there in feedburner feeds too, so I would call that a bug in
    Thunderbird. I hope they will fix it in the next version.'

  comment_content: This is slightly off-topic. Sorry about that.\n\nWhy do you use
    feedburner instead of WP's own feed? A lot of people seem to do this, and I don't
    know why.

  comment_content: '@Emil: I''m mostly brainstorming but if you look at Jeremy Keith
    he doesn''t have any trackbacks either - he only shows related posts through Technorati.\n\nTo
    disconnect comments from blogs and promote them into blog posts of their own can
    have many benefits. It for example enables more complex relations between it and
    others posts. One such comment can be related to many sources at once as is often
    the case when blogs are commenting Swedish media that are using Twingly.\n\nBoth
    Technorati and Twingly has tools to track such comments and we in Sweden has got
    the cool Knuff-alternative as well.'

  comment_content: indeed, it's harder (and less willing) to read comments of blog
    posts... in fact, since i started using google reader 2 weeks ago, I only read
    what's available in the ready, and prefer not to dig down the rabbit hole.

  comment_content: '@Jesper Särnesjö: Because feedburner gives me daily statistics
    on the number of reader. Really nice.\n\n@Pelle: I see what you mean, but I still
    think using both is the best way. If I''m only promoting comments on other''s
    blogs, how do people with no blog comment?\n\n@Travis: But would you read them,
    if they were easier to access?'

  comment_content: '@Emil: Yeah, one will propably have to keep usual comments until
    blogs/microblogs/similar becomes as usual as e-mail and IM is today - or one has
    to make it extremely easy to create a new microblog for the visitor.\n\nMy point
    was though that perhaps the feed readers shouldn''t put too much of an effort
    into promoting ordinary blog comments instead of trying to find the comments that
    has been made elsewhere in the blogosphere?\n\nFor example - what if Google Reader
    showed you which X feeds that you''re following has commented on the feed entry
    you''re currently reading and also show you that X entries from feeds you''re
    not following has commented on the entry as well? Would be really nice and not
    require to much work to build :)'

  comment_content: '@Pelle: It really would! Wordpress already shows blog links to
    your blog found on google blogsearch; it wouldn''t be hard to implement that on
    Google Reader aswell.'
